Comments:
Hi Tony, overall good job on this. I have a few comments: 1. I believe you still need a Social and Behavioral Science GE. 2. You have an extra CSE technical elective on here. 9 hours of tech electives must be CSE hours, but the other 8 are covered by your Linguistics minor. 3. You need an additional hour of math and science electives - look for a one hour course. I recommend Entomology 4600. 4. You need an additional GE theme course in the same theme as Anthrop3050. If you do not want to take another course, then you should try and find a 4 hour theme course to meet your second theme
