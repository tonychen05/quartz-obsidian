For the Computer Science and Engineering program, describe how a degree in that area will help you to achieve your career goals and address the problems that interest you.

For me, a computer science and engineering degree would open up doors into the world of technology. Artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, cybersecurity, the internet of things, virtual reality, and augmented reality, the invaluable knowledge gained from studying in the program and receiving the degree would allow me to tackle the subjects that I am interested in. One of my career goals is to create something that would greatly increase the convenience of people's daily lives and push the limits of technology. In the same way that you wouldn't compare the technology 500, 100, 50, or even 20 years ago to the technology of today, I find it exciting to think about what could be created in the future and want to be a part of it. 

Many people are extremely pessimistic about technological advancements such as more advanced generative AI or even runaway AI. For example, OpenAI's new text-to-video AI model, Sora, is no doubt a great technological feat but it is scary as well. The evolution of generative AI tools makes it increasingly difficult to separate fact from fiction, which is already a big problem as misinformation is rampant on social media. However, I am cautiously optimistic about the improving rate of technology. After all, humankind has already experienced many unpredictable events throughout the eras but has overcome and adapted through them all so regardless of what happens in the future, we will find solutions and I hope to contribute with my computer science degree.

# 2) Diversity Essay
Problems in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) are inherently complex. Solving them requires extensive teamwork and collaboration. Research shows teams that are diverse in terms of how members process information, in social perspectives, and lived experience tend to be more creative, faster, and effective in their problem solving.  
  
With this definition of diversity in mind, reflect on and discuss your experiences working in teams. What have you learned from those experiences that you can apply or share as you progress in your education and career?  
  
[Here, ‘team’ refers to any group of people working together; could be family members, co-workers, students, neighbors, etc. ]

Throughout my academic journey, I have done my fair share of group projects and have certainly gleaned a lot of experiences. During my high school career, I would find myself in situations where I would do most of the work. Originally, I was frustrated because I thought they weren't pulling their weight but I eventually came to realize that my idea of how a project should be done heavily differed from their view. While I aimed for an A, they were content with a passing grade. I always thought in the back of my head that at least college wouldn't have group projects; I was so wrong.

From the very first day of college, I knew that group work was going to be even more prevalent and would follow me forever for the rest of my life. So, I had to re-evaluate my stance, or else I would be crying into my pillow every night and losing hair due to stress taking on all the work. I made a resolution that I would not be pushed around and made the scapegoat for other people's work and I will not take on unnecessary burdens further than necessary. 

From personal experience, I can not affirm the research on diverse teams simply because, surprisingly, I have always been in very diverse teams and therefore have no control group, but I can easily see why diversity would be advantageous. Diverse teams are bound to bring unique viewpoints and different abilities which is a powerful catalyst for increased creativity and effectiveness in problem solving.

# 3) Life Experience Essay
Pursuing a degree in a STEM field requires determination, as well as the ability to master coursework. With this in mind, please describe any experiences, challenges, or circumstances that have influenced or affected your academic performance or your desire to pursue a degree in STEM.

PHYSICS 1250 was by far the most challenging course I have ever taken and I think it could be attributed to many factors. This course was my first introduction to physics and its concepts and personally required a shift in thinking because I was more accustomed to memorization-based subjects from high school. Physics also deals with abstract concepts that do not align with everyday experiences and perceptions. One thing in particular that I had a hard time grasping was that in fluid dynamics, an increase in the fluid's velocity corresponds to a decrease in pressure. That was so different from what I thought I had known intuitively.

However, despite the difficulty, I would not say that it negatively influenced my desire to pursue a degree in STEM. In fact, it may have strengthened it because I thought, "If I could pass Physics, I can pass anything." Quite frankly, I can't imagine a scenario in which I completely give up on pursuing a degree in STEM because this field just really stands out to me. I feel that a STEM education is the foundation for scientific discovery and advancements that propel society forward and the impact permeates every aspect of our lives. To hold a degree in STEM is to hold a beacon that illuminates the path toward progress and innovation (I know this sentence is kind of corny but I mean it).
