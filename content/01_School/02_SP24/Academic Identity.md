I chose Ohio State simply because it made the most financial sense to me and the fact that OSU had a reputable Computer Science and Engineering department. As I gaze into the haze of the next decade, I do not really know what life will look like for me. Ideally, I will be employed, working, and able to independently support myself whilst enjoying life and travelling with friends and family. An Ohio State education can help prepare me for the life I intend by endowing me with the knowledge and skills necessary to land a job and shaping me into an individual equipped for the future trajectory I envision. When I will eventually face setbacks—be it disappointment, discouragement, or failure—in my academic career, I will dwell on it for no more than 24 hours. After the brief interlude, I will reflect on what happened, learn from it, and pick myself back up to continue forging my future.
