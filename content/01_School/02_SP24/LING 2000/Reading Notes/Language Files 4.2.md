## 4.2.1 The Processes of Forming Words
- English and other languages utilize affixes for word formation.
- Affixation in word formation is systematic and rule-governed.
- Word formation processes involve the creation of new words or forms of words.
- The various word formation processes include [[derivation]] and [[inflection]].
## 4.2.2 Affixation
- Affixation is a process observed in various languages for word formation.
- English primarily uses prefixes and suffixes, while other languages may also employ infixes.
- Infixes are inserted within the root morpheme, unlike prefixes and suffixes.
- English does not have regular infixes, although some colloquial speech or slang may exhibit infix-like formations.
- In Tagalog, a major Austronesian language, infixes are extensively used for word formation.

**Examples of Affixation in Tagalog:**
- In Tagalog, the infix "um-" is inserted after the first consonant of a verb root to form the infinitive.
- Examples:
    - Verb Root: lakad (meaning "walk")
        - Infinitive: lumakad (meaning "to walk")
    - Verb Root: bili (meaning "buy")
        - Infinitive: bumili (meaning "to buy")
    - Verb Root: kuha (meaning "take, get")
        - Infinitive: kumuha (meaning "to take, to get")
## 4.2.3 Affixation in Signed Languages
**Affixation in Signed Languages:**
- Signed languages employ affixation similarly to spoken languages, where gestures can precede or follow a stem gesture.
- Affixes in signed languages modify gestures by adding movements or changing @zparameters.
- Examples of affixation in American Sign Language (ASL) include suffixes for negation and inflectional markers for subjects and objects in verbs.

**Examples of Reversal of Orientation for Negation in ASL:**
- Negation suffixes in ASL involve a rapid turning over of the hand, affixed to the end of the root sign.
- The resulting movement reverses the hand orientation from the original sign, indicating negation.
- Examples include:
  - LIKE vs. DON’T-LIKE
  - WANT vs. DON’T-WANT
  - KNOW vs. DON’T-KNOW

**Simultaneous Affixation in Signed Languages:**
- In signed languages, affixes can appear simultaneously with the stem, unlike in spoken languages.
- Simultaneous affixation is common in signed languages and follows similar rules to linear affixation.
- Most simultaneous affixation in signed languages is inflectional rather than derivational.
- Examples include verb inflection for subjects and objects, where the sign originates in one location and terminates in another.
- Adverbial inflection of adjectives is another example, modifying the sign's movement without changing its parameters.
## 4.2.4 Compounding
**Compounding:**
- Compounding is a word formation process where new words are created by combining two or more independent words.
- The parts of compounds can be free morphemes, words derived by affixation, or even compounds themselves.

**Examples of English Compounds:**
- Compounds can consist of free morphemes, affixed words, or compounded words.
- Examples in English include:
  - Free Morphemes: girlfriend, blackbird
  - Affixed Words: air-conditioner, ironing board
  - Compounded Words: lifeguard chair, aircraft carrier

**Representation of Compounds in English:**
- Compounds in English are not consistently represented in writing; they may be written together, with a hyphen, or separately.
- Regardless of their written form, compounds form words and not syntactic phrases, as indicated by their stress patterns.

**Stress Patterns in Compounds:**
- Compounds have primary stress on the first word only, while individual words in phrases have independent primary stress.
- Examples:
  - Compound: blackbird (primary stress on "black")
  - Phrase: black bird (primary stress on both "black" and "bird")

**Complexity and Productivity of Compounding:**
- English speakers may not always be aware of how productive compounding is due to inconsistent writing practices.
- Longer compounds in English demonstrate the complexity of compound structures.
- Examples of longer compounds include "income tax preparation fees" and "mint chocolate chip ice cream waffle cone."

**Compounding in German:**
- German also utilizes compounding to form new words.
- Examples of compound words in German include:
  - Muttersprache (meaning "native language")
  - Schreibtisch (meaning "desk")
  - Wunderkind (meaning "child prodigy")
  - Parkzeitüberschreitung (meaning "exceeding of the amount of park time")
## 4.2.5 Reduplication
**Reduplication:**
- Reduplication is a word formation process involving the duplication of either an entire free morpheme (total reduplication) or part of it (partial reduplication).
- While English doesn't systematically use reduplication in its grammar, there are a few nonsystematic cases, often for indicating intensity or prototypicality in colloquial speech.

**Examples of Reduplication in English:**
- Reduplication in English may indicate intensity or prototypicality and can occur with verbs, adjectives, and nouns.
- Examples:
  - "like-like" (to express a stronger liking)
  - "green-green" (to specify a particular shade of green)
  - "date-date" (to emphasize a genuine romantic outing)

**Reduplication in Indonesian:**
- Indonesian utilizes total reduplication as an inflectional process to form plurals of nouns.
- Examples:
  - Singular: rumah (meaning "house")
    - Plural: rumah-rumah (meaning "houses")
  - Singular: ibu (meaning "mother")
    - Plural: ibu-ibu (meaning "mothers")

**Reduplication in ASL:**
- American Sign Language (ASL) also employs reduplication for plural formation, derivational, and inflectional purposes, although not universally.
  
**Reduplication in Tagalog:**
- Tagalog uses partial reduplication for inflection and derivation, such as in forming the future tense of verbs or occupations.
- Examples:
  - Future Tense:
    - Verb Root: bili (meaning "buy")
      - Future Tense: bibili (meaning "will buy")
  - Derivation of Occupations:
    - Occupation: mamimili (meaning "buyer")
      - Verb: bili (meaning "buy")
    - Occupation: manunulat (meaning "writer")
      - Verb: sulat (meaning "write")
    - Occupation: maŋiŋisda (meaning "fisherman")
      - Verb: ?isda (meaning "fish")

## 4.2.6 Alternation
**Alternation:**
- Alternation refers to morpheme-internal modifications used to create new words or different grammatical forms of a word.
- These changes in sounds within a word mark meaningful morphological distinctions, unlike phonological rules, which deal with pronunciation independent of meaning.

**Examples of Alternation in English:**
- Plural Formation:
  - Some English nouns form their plurals by internal modification, such as vowel alternation, rather than suffixation.
  - Examples include:
    - Singular: man - Plural: men
    - Singular: woman - Plural: women
    - Singular: goose - Plural: geese
    - Singular: tooth - Plural: teeth
    - Singular: louse - Plural: lice

- Past Tense and Past Participle Forms:
  - Some English verbs form their past tense and past participle forms through internal modification, particularly vowel alternation.
  - Examples include:
    - Present: ring - Past: rang - Past Participle: rung
    - Present: drink - Past: drank - Past Participle: drunk
    - Present: feed - Past: fed - Past Participle: fed
    - Present: read - Past: read - Past Participle: read
    - Present: hold - Past: held - Past Participle: held

**Alternation in Derivation:**
- Morphological alternation can also be used in derivation, such as in changing lexical category.
- Examples include nouns changing to verbs with alteration in the final consonant, particularly with voicing.
- Examples:
  - Noun: grief - Verb: grieve
  - Noun: tooth - Verb: teethe
  - Noun: use - Verb: use
  - Noun: house - Verb: house
  - Noun: proof - Verb: prove

**Alternation in Other Languages:**
- Alternation is a common phenomenon in other languages as well, such as Hebrew.
- Examples from Hebrew show derivational alternation between nouns and verbs, indicating a change in lexical category.
- Examples include:
  - Verb: limed (meaning "he taught") - Noun: limud (meaning "lesson")
  - Verb: sijem (meaning "he finished") - Noun: sijum (meaning "end")
  - Verb: tijel (meaning "he traveled") - Noun: tijul (meaning "trip")
  - Verb: bikeγ (meaning "he visited") - Noun: bikuγ (meaning "visit")
  - Verb: dibeγ (meaning "he spoke") - Noun: dibuγ (meaning "speech")

## 4.2.7 Templatic Morphology
**Templatic Morphology:**

- Templatic morphology, also known as root-and-pattern morphology, is a type of morphology found notably in Semitic languages.
- In templatic morphology, roots consist only of consonants, and vowels are added to create specific inflectional and derivational forms.
- Each inflected or derived form of a word follows a template or pattern into which the consonants of the root are inserted, along with added vowels and consonants.

**Example of Templatic Morphology in Modern Standard Arabic:**

- Example with the triconsonantal root /ktb/ meaning "write":
  - Forms include:
    - [kataba] - "he wrote"
    - [yaktubu] - "he is writing"
    - [maktu:b] - "written"
    - [katb] - "writing" (noun)
    - [ka:tib] - "writer"
    - [kita:b] - "book"
    - [maktab] - "office"
    - [maka:tib] - "offices"

**Similar Patterns in Other Verb Roots:**
- Similar patterns are found in other verb roots, though the quality of vowels may vary depending on the particular verb root.
- Examples with the triconsonantal roots /ksr/ meaning "break" and /fqd/ meaning "lose" demonstrate this.
- Forms include:
  - For /ksr/: [kasara] - "he broke", [maksu:r] - "broken", [kasr] - "breaking" (noun)
  - For /fqd/: [faqada] - "he lost", [mafqu:d] - "lost", [faqd] - "losing" (noun)

**Variation in Root Consonants:**
- In some cases, the consonants of the root can be realized with different segmental features.
- Example with the triconsonantal root /mlk/ in Hebrew demonstrates this, where the final consonant /k/ can sometimes be realized as the voiceless velar fricative [x].

**Types of Templatic Roots:**
- Templatic roots in languages like Arabic and Hebrew can consist of two to five consonants, with three-consonant roots being the most common.

## 4.2.8 Suprasegmental Morphology
**Suprasegmental Morphology:**
- Suprasegmental morphology involves the use of [[Language Files 2.4-2.5#2.5 Suprasegmental Features|suprasegmental features]], such as tone and stress, in word formation processes.

**Tonal Morphology:**
- Tone, the pitch at which syllables of a word are pronounced, is used in languages like Mandarin and Kikerewe to distinguish words.
- In some languages, tone is also used for inflection and derivation, known as tonal morphology.
- Example: Tlatepuzco Chinantec verbs for "cut" demonstrate tonal morphology, where differences in person, number, and aspect/mood are marked solely by tone.

**Examples of Tonal Morphology in Tlatepuzco Chinantec:**
- Aspect/Mood | 1st Singular | 1st Plural | 2nd Person | 3rd Person
  - Completive: [tiu1] | [tiu3] | [tiu32] | [tiu1]
  - Incompletive: [tiu12] | [tiu2] | [tiu2] | [tiu12]
  - Irrealis: [tiu13] | [tiu3] | [tiu3] | [tiu1]

**Stress-Based Morphology in English:**
- Stress, another suprasegmental feature, is used in a derivational process between certain nouns and verbs in English.
- Example: In nouns like "extract," "increase," and "permit," primary stress is on the first syllable, while in corresponding verbs, primary stress shifts to the second syllable.
- This shift in stress can lead to changes in phonetic form due to regular phonological rules.
- Example: "produce" (noun) has primary stress on the first syllable, resulting in the full vowel [oU], while "produce" (verb) has primary stress on the second syllable, causing the first syllable vowel to reduce to schwa.

## 4.2.9 Morphological Metathesis
**Morphological Metathesis:**
- Metathesis is a process that switches the order of two sounds, and when used as a word formation process, it's known as morphological metathesis.
- Morphological metathesis involves switching the position of sounds in a word to create new grammatical forms or inflections.

**Examples of Morphological Metathesis:**
- Example from Straits Saanich:
  - Underlying Form /kwut/ (Non-actual) changes to Actual Form /ukwt/ 'shoot'
  - Underlying Form /xit/ changes to Actual Form /xit/ 'scratch'
  - Underlying Form /qqit/ changes to Actual Form /qiqt/ 'restrain'
  - Underlying Form /tet/ changes to Actual Form /tet/ 'shatter'

- Example from Rotuman:
  - Underlying Form /hepa/ (Complete) changes to Incomplete Form /hjap/ 'broad'
  - Underlying Form /mamhula/ changes to Incomplete Form /mamhwOl/ 'with bulging cheeks'
  - Underlying Form /rito/ changes to Incomplete Form /rjot/ 'to glitter'
  - Underlying Form /hosa/ changes to Incomplete Form /hwas/ 'flower'
  - Underlying Form /una/ changes to Incomplete Form /wOn/ 'fish scale'

**Interaction with Phonological Processes:**
- Morphological metathesis in Rotuman interacts with various phonological processes, such as vowel raising and changes in vowel quality.

**Productivity and Loanwords:**
- Morphological metathesis in Rotuman is productive and applies even to loanwords, as seen in forms like /pepa/ changing to [pjap] 'paper' and /fika/ changing to [fjOk] 'number' from English words 'paper' and 'figure', respectively.

**Implications:**
- Morphological metathesis, like other morphological processes, challenges the simple model of morphology that involves attaching morphemes, as it involves whole-word changes to convey grammatical meanings.
