### Overview of "Everyone Has an Accent Except Me" by John H. Esling.

1. **Everyone has an accent:** Contrary to the belief of some individuals that they don't have an accent, the passage asserts that everyone does. Accents reflect our background, upbringing, and experiences, conveying information about where we come from, our gender, age, education, occupation, and even physical characteristics.
    
2. **Accent as a marker of belonging:** Accents define and communicate who we are, serving as a map that listeners use to identify where the speaker is from and other aspects of their identity. Accent plays a crucial role in signaling belonging to a particular group or community.
    
3. **Accent is relative:** Our perception of whether someone has an accent depends on our own background and experiences. What may be considered a standard accent in one context may be perceived as an accent in another context. Standards of accent often reflect social hierarchies and power dynamics.
    
4. **Accommodation and change:** People may accommodate their speech patterns to fit in with a new environment or social group, consciously or unconsciously. However, the extent to which individuals retain or modify their accents varies based on personal preferences and social circumstances.
    
5. **Components of accent:** Accents involve various components, including consonants, vowels, rhythm, intonation, and voice quality. These elements contribute to the unique sound of an individual's speech and can differ significantly between speakers.
    
6. **Perception of accent:** Human perception of accent is categorical, and we tend to categorize accents based on our prior experiences. Differences in accent can lead to stereotypes and influence how we perceive and interact with others.
    
7. **Accent modification:** The passage mentions the concept of accent modification, illustrated through characters like Eliza Doolittle in "Pygmalion" and "My Fair Lady." Accent modification can result from changes in social circumstances and personal identity.
