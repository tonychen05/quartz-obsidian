# 7.3 Drawing Conclusions
## 7.3.1 Drawing Conclusions: Entailment
- **Understanding Utterances and Drawing Conclusions**
    - Drawing conclusions from utterances about the world is crucial for comprehension.
    - Different kinds of evidence or reasoning can lead to these conclusions.
    - The type of reasoning used depends on the context of the utterance being interpreted.
- **Entailment in Drawing Conclusions**
    - Entailment: If sentence X is true, then sentence Y must also be true.
    - Example: "Ian eats a large breakfast every day" entails "Ian eats a large breakfast on Mondays."
    - Entailment reflects a commitment from the speaker's perspective and allows confident conclusions for the hearer.
- **Literal Meaning and Context**
    - Entailment is based on literal meaning, independent of context.
    - However, utterances often convey additional information beyond literal entailment.
    - Speakers intend to convey extra information beyond what is literally asserted.
    - Hearers routinely draw conclusions from utterances based on context, even if not entailed by the spoken sentence.

## 7.3.2 Drawing Conclusions: Inference, Implication, and Implicature
- **Inferences and the Cooperative Principle**
    - People commonly draw inferences from what others say assuming adherence to the Cooperative Principle.
    - Focus shifts to understanding the process of drawing such inferences.
- **Non-Linguistic Inferences**
    - Inferences can occur without explicit linguistic communication.
    - Example: An employee signaling the meeting's prolonged duration by glancing at their watch or phone.
- **Definition of Inference**
    - An inference is a conclusion drawn based on circumstances.
    - Inferences can be made even when no one is trying to imply anything.
- **Implicature in Language**
    - Implicature occurs when a speaker implies something using language.
    - Implicatures are conclusions drawn about meaning based on conversational norms.
    - Various types of implicatures exist, often related to Grice's maxims for cooperative conversation.

## 7.3.3 Implicature Based on the Maxim of Relevance
- **Implicature Generation**
    - Any maxim from Grice's maxims for cooperative conversation can contribute to generating an implicature in a suitable context.
    - Example: Conversation at a bus stop where Speaker 1 expresses a desire for coffee and Speaker 2 mentions Joe's.
- **Implicature Analysis**
    - Speaker 2's utterance (X) "There’s a place around the corner called Joe’s" does not entail that Joe's sells coffee.
    - Conclusion Y ("Joe’s sells coffee") is an inference based on implicature rather than entailment.
    - Implicature arises from Speaker 1's expectation of relevance in the conversation. Changing the subject mid-conversation is uncommon.
    - Implicature justification involves considering pragmatic concepts like context and conversational norms.
- **Comparison with Previous Example**
    - Recall the example from File 7.2 where Sam implies that Jamie is dating someone based on her visits to Cleveland.
    - Sam's utterance relies on the assumption of relevance, allowing the listener to infer additional information without explicit statements.
- **Importance of Context**
    - Context plays a crucial role in implicature generation.
    - Without knowledge of Jamie's reason for visiting Cleveland, Sam's statement could be misleading or infelicitous.
## 7.3.4 Implicature Based on the Maxim of Quantity
- **Implicature Based on Maxim of Quantity**
    - Implicatures can arise from adherence to the first maxim of quantity: providing as much information as required.
    - Example: Conversation between a mother and her son about homework completion.
- **Analysis of Conversation Content**
    - Son's statement (X) "I’ve finished my history homework" doesn't entail that he hasn't finished homework for other classes.
    - Mother likely infers (Y) "I have not finished my homework for my other classes" because her question seeks information about all classes, not just history.
- **Common Source of Quantity Implicatures: Numbers**
    - Numbers often lead to implicatures regarding exact quantity.
    - Example: Dialogue between Gail and Kim about running distance.
    - Gail infers "exactly ten miles, and no more" from Kim's answer "ten miles," assuming adherence to the maxim of quantity.
    - Kim's response, though technically true, violates the maxim of quantity as it implies a specific quantity when the entailed meaning is "at least" that quantity.
- **Perception of Deceptiveness**
    - Implicatures based on numbers can lead to perceptions of deception, even if the statement is technically true.
    - Clear violations of the maxim of quantity can make statements appear deceptive, despite adhering to the maxim of quality.
## 7.3.5 Implicature Based on the Maxim of Manner
- **Maxims of Manner in Storytelling**
    - Grice's maxims of manner guide speakers to be orderly and brief in their communication.
- **Orderliness in Storytelling**
    - Example: Stories told in different orders can lead to different inferences.
    - (8) "Rebecca took the medication and had an allergic reaction."
        - Inference: Rebecca had an allergic reaction to the medication.
    - (9) "Rebecca had an allergic reaction and took the medication."
        - Inference: Rebecca took the medication to counter her allergic reaction to something else.
- **Brevity Implicature**
    - Another maxim of manner suggests speakers be brief.
    - Example: Utterance "The man who lives with me is an electrician."
        - Inference: Speaker likely refers to a housemate or apartment mate rather than a closer relationship like husband or partner.
        - Implicature arises because "my husband" is shorter than "the man who lives with me," so the speaker would likely use the shorter phrase if true.
## 7.3.6 Implicature Based on the Maxim of Quality
- **Maxim of Quality and Standards of Evidence**
    - The second maxim of quality dictates that assertions should be based on adequate evidence.
    - Individuals may differ in their standards for what constitutes sufficient evidence for their assertions.
- **Inferences Based on Assumed Standards of Evidence**
    - Inferences can be drawn assuming shared standards of evidence with conversational partners.
    - Example: Conversation between Sandy and Tom about making a chocolate cake.
- **Implicature vs. Entailment**
    - Sandy might infer that Tom has made his family’s favorite chocolate cake before based on his assertion.
    - However, this inference is not entailed by Tom's statement; it is implicated.
    - Tom's statement could be based on factors like having a recipe and familiarity with the process rather than direct experience.
- **Challenges to Assertions**
    - Sandy's reaction to Tom's failed attempt at making the cake illustrates justified skepticism due to insufficient evidence.
    - Tom's assertion and subsequent failure prompt Sandy's challenge, indicating that she expected higher evidence standards.
- **Openness to Differences of Opinion**
    - Whether Tom was justified in his assertion depends on differing opinions about evidence standards.
    - Awareness of differing standards of evidence is crucial in communication to understand when inferences might be drawn beyond what is explicitly stated.

## 7.3.7 The Significant of Implicatures to Communication
- **Implicatures as Side Effects of Grice's Maxims**
    - Implicatures are a byproduct of Grice's maxims, which primarily describe principles guiding conversational interactions.
    - Despite being side effects, implicatures are highly useful in discourse.
- **Advantages of Implicature**
    - Implicatures enable the introduction of ideas into discourse with less commitment compared to entailing the same propositions.
    - They provide flexibility and allow speakers to communicate ideas while avoiding explicit commitment to them.
    - In the example of Sam responding to Alana's question about Jamie dating, implicature allows Sam to hint at information without fully committing to it.
- **Functions of Implicature**
    - Implicature serves a fundamental function in making conversation easier and more efficient.
    - Without implicature, conversations would proceed at a slow pace as speakers would need to ensure logical impeccability and explicit entailment of every fact.
    - Context and knowledge about the universe facilitate drawing inferences from utterances, enhancing communication effectiveness and creativity.
- **Creativity and Interest in Conversations**
    - Implicature enables language users to be more creative in their communication, making conversations and everyday interactions more interesting.
    - It allows for the exploration of nuanced meanings and the expression of ideas beyond strict literal interpretations.

# 7.4 Speech Acts
## 7.4.1 An Introduction to Speech Acts
- **Introduction to Speech Acts**
    - Just as people perform physical and mental acts, they also perform acts through language called speech acts.
    - Speech acts encompass a wide range of activities, including conveying information, requesting information, giving orders, making requests, making threats, giving warnings, making bets, giving advice, offering apologies, telling jokes, and paying compliments.
- **Importance of Speech Acts**
    - The ability to perform speech acts makes language immensely useful.
    - Language allows individuals to accomplish tasks that would otherwise be impossible or difficult.
    - For example, making a bet (as in sentence 7) or giving advice (as in sentence 8) would be challenging without language.
- **Common Speech Acts and Their Functions**
    - Assertion: Conveys information.
    - Question: Elicits information.
    - Request: Elicits action or information (more or less politely).
    - Order: Demands action.
    - Promise: Commits the speaker to an action.
    - Threat: Commits the speaker to an action that the hearer does not want.
- **Versatility of Language**
    - Language can be used for a myriad of purposes beyond the common speech acts listed.
    - Speech acts play a fundamental role in communication, enabling individuals to interact effectively and efficiently.

## 7.4.2 Felicity Conditions
- **Felicity Conditions for Speech Acts**
    - Each type of speech act has specific conditions, called felicity conditions, that must be met for the act to be felicitous.
    - Felicity conditions ensure that the speech act serves its intended purpose effectively.
- **Examples of Felicity Conditions**
    - Felicity conditions for requests include the belief that the action has not been done, the desire for the action to be done, belief in the hearer's ability to do the action, and belief in the hearer's potential willingness to do it.
    - Felicity conditions for questions include the lack of knowledge about the state of affairs, the desire to know that information, and belief in the hearer's ability to supply the information.
- **Purpose of Felicity Conditions**
    - Felicity conditions align with the goals of speech acts. For requests, the goal is task accomplishment, so conditions ensure that the task can be completed effectively.
    - Understanding felicity conditions helps determine when it is appropriate to use different speech acts in various social contexts.
- **Exceptions and Modifications**
    - While speech acts generally adhere to felicity conditions, there are exceptions and modifications in certain contexts.
    - For example, in trivia games, the condition of genuinely wanting information may be suspended, or in a classroom setting, all three conditions for questions may be modified to suit the educational context.
- **Importance of Felicity Conditions in Understanding Speech Acts**
    - Considering felicity conditions for each speech act helps in understanding the speaker's beliefs and desires necessary for the act to be felicitous.
    - Throughout the discussion of speech acts, it's helpful to think about them in terms of their respective felicity conditions to grasp their appropriateness and effectiveness in communication.
## 7.4.3 Performative Verbs and Performative Speech Acts
- **Performative Speech Acts**
    - Performative speech acts are a special type where the action named by the verb is accomplished in the act of speaking itself.
    - Unlike typical assertions or descriptions, performative verbs denote purely linguistic actions.
- **Examples of Performative Speech Acts**
    - Examples include assertions, questions, orders, requests, threats, warnings, bets, and advice.
    - These speech acts can also be performed by embedding sentences as complements of verbs that state the speech act.
- **Specialized Performative Verbs in Ceremonies**
    - Certain ceremonies or formal actions require the use of performative verbs.
    - Specialized performative verbs not only perform a speech act but also change something about the world, such as legal relationships or the naming of objects.
- **Felicity Conditions for Performative Speech Acts**
    - Specialized performative verbs often have additional felicity conditions associated with the authority of the speaker.
    - Infelicitous use of specialized performative verbs results in no effect on the world, and they must fulfill various felicity conditions to be fully effective.
- **Contextual Impact on Performative Speech Acts**
    - The context in which performative speech acts are uttered determines their impact and effectiveness.
    - Fulfilling felicity conditions is crucial in understanding the appropriateness and effectiveness of performative speech acts in different situations.

## 7.4.4 Identifying Performative Speech Acts
- **Distinguishing Performative Speech Acts**
    - Not all sentences containing verbs that can be used performatively are performative speech acts.
    - Only sentences where the subject is first person (I or we) and the verb is in the present tense constitute performative speech acts.
- **Examples**
    - In sentence (25), "I promise I will help you with your project this week," the verb "promise" is used performatively because it meets the criteria: first-person subject and present tense verb.
    - In sentences (26) and (27), the verb "promise" is not used performatively because the subject is third person (John) and the verb is in the future tense.
- **The "Hereby" Test**
    - One test to determine if a verb is being used performatively is the hereby test.
    - By inserting "hereby" before the potentially performative verb, we can check if the sentence sounds acceptable.
    - If the sentence sounds acceptable with "hereby," then the verb is being used performatively; otherwise, it is not.
- **Difficulty of the Test**
    - Sometimes, the hereby test may be difficult to use because certain sentences sound awkward with "hereby."
    - Awkwardness may arise due to infrequent usage of performative verbs or the archaic connotation of "hereby." However, some sentences, like (20) above, naturally accommodate "hereby."

## 7.4.5 Direct and Indirect Speech Acts
- **Direct Speech Acts**:
    - Direct speech acts perform their functions in a direct and literal manner.
    - They can be performed by making a direct, literal utterance or by using a performative verb that names the speech act.
- **Indirect Speech Acts**:
    - Indirect speech acts are performed indirectly, especially when trying to be polite.
    - They involve using felicity conditions to convey the intended meaning indirectly.
    - Examples of indirect speech acts include questions and requests.
- **Examples**:
    - **Direct Questions**: "Did John marry Helen?" or "I'm asking you whether John married Helen."
    - **Indirect Questions**: "I don’t know if John married Helen." or "I would like to know if John married Helen."
    - **Direct Requests**: "(Please) Take out the garbage." or "I request that you take out the garbage."
    - **Indirect Requests**: "The garbage hasn’t been taken out yet." or "I would like for you to take out the garbage."
- **Connection with Felicity Conditions**:
    - Indirect speech acts are closely connected with the felicity conditions on speech acts.
    - They often appeal to a particular felicity condition to convey the intended meaning indirectly.
- **Politeness Considerations**:
    - Indirect speech acts are often indicative of politeness considerations on behalf of the speaker.
    - For example, instead of assuming that a certain felicity condition on requests holds, the speaker might politely ask if it does, as in "Would you mind taking me to work?"

## 7.4.6 Identifying Indirect Speech Acts
- **Determining Indirect Speech Acts**:
    - Performative speech acts are always direct.
    - If the speech act is not performative, it might be indirect.
    - Check whether any felicity conditions are violated for the sentence’s literal meaning but not for its intended meaning.
- **Checking Felicity Conditions**:
    - Consider whether the felicity conditions for the literal meaning of the sentence are violated.
    - Compare the intended meaning with the conditions for other speech acts to determine if it fits better as an indirect speech act.
- **Response in Context**:
    - Consider how people normally respond to the utterance in context.
    - Different speech acts elicit different responses.
    - If the standard response is different from what the literal meaning would arouse, then it is likely an indirect speech act.
- **Example**:
    - For example, the sentence "Could you take out the garbage?" might seem like a question, but in typical contexts, it elicits the response of actually carrying out the action, indicating that it functions as an indirect speech act of making a request rather than a direct question.

## 7.4.7 Sentences and Their Relation to Speech Acts
- **Relationship Between Speech Acts and Sentences**:
    - Speech acts are identified by the speakers' goals, and there are various ways to perform the same speech act using different sentences.
    - Declarative, interrogative, and imperative sentences are associated with assertion, question, and order/request respectively, but this association does not always hold.
- **Context Dependency**:
    - The interpretation of a sentence's function depends on context, including prosody and other factors.
    - Different sentence types (declarative, interrogative, imperative) can be used to perform different speech acts depending on context.
- **Direct and Indirect Speech Acts**:
    - Any of the three sentence types can be used to perform any of the three speech acts.
    - Sometimes the pairing between sentence form and speech act results in a direct speech act, while other times it yields an indirect speech act.
- **Examples**:
    - Declarative sentences can be used for assertions, interrogative sentences for questions, and imperative sentences for orders/requests, but there are exceptions.
    - The choice between direct and indirect speech acts, along with the syntax and words used, depends on the speaker's intention and the desired effect.
