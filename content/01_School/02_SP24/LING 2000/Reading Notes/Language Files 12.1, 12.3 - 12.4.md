# 12.1 Language Contact
## 12.1.1 Languages in Contact

#### Definition and Types of Language Contact
- Language contact involves the interaction of distinct languages either indirectly (through written form and media) or directly (through social contact).
- Contact can occur due to globalization, trade, conquest, migration, or other factors.
  
#### Historical Examples of Language Contact
- Expansion of the Roman Empire led to the replacement of local languages by Latin.
- Latin in the Iberian Peninsula came into contact with Arabic, influencing each other.
- Immigration to the United States has resulted in contact between Spanish and American English, impacting language varieties.

#### Impact of Language Contact
- Contact situations influence linguistic systems, social relationships among speakers, and linguistic outcomes.
- Examples of language influence include phonological, morphological, and syntactic changes.

## 12.1.2 Levels of Borrowing

#### Definition of Borrowing
- Borrowing involves the adoption of linguistic elements from one language by another.
- It can be lexical (words and phrases) or structural (phonological, morphological, or syntactic patterns).
#### Types of Borrowing
- **Lexical Borrowing**: Adoption of individual words, known as loanwords.
  - Examples include ballet, chaise (French), macho, taco (Spanish), pizza, spaghetti (Italian), etc.
- **Phonological Borrowing**: Adoption of new sounds or phonological rules.
  - Example: Introduction of [Z] into English from French through loanwords like "rouge" and "leisure."
- **Morphological Borrowing**: Adoption of morphological elements or patterns.
  - Example: English maintains Latin plural forms, e.g., colloquia.
- **Syntactic Borrowing**: Adoption of ordering requirements from one language into another.
  - Example: Romansch changed its noun-before-adjective order to adjective-before-noun under German influence.
#### Limitations of Borrowing
- **Core Vocabulary**: Basic universal words like body parts, familial relations, or environmental entities are less likely to be borrowed.
- **Function Words**: Words like articles, pronouns, and prepositions are typically not borrowed due to their universality across languages.
- **Phrases and Idiomatic Expressions**: Whole phrases and idiomatic expressions can also be borrowed, known as loan translations or calques.

## 12.1.3 Contact Situations

#### Intensity of Contact
- Intensity of contact ranges from high to low and is determined by the duration and level of interaction among speakers.
- High-intensity contact involves long-term interaction, while low-intensity contact involves limited interaction.
#### Relationship between Intensity and Contact-induced Change
- Lexical borrowing requires low-intensity contact, while structural borrowing necessitates bilingualism and thus a higher degree of contact.
- Structural borrowing involves adopting elements from the phonology, morphology, or syntax of another language.
#### Social Factors Influencing Contact
- Prestige of speakers affects linguistic systems; adstratal relationships occur when speakers are equally prestigious, while substratum/superstratum relationships occur when there's an imbalance in prestige.
- In adstratal relationships, borrowing is bidirectional, while in substratum/superstratum relationships, borrowing is typically unidirectional, with the superstratum language being the donor.

> [!INFO] Define: adstratum
> An adstratum (plural: adstrata) or adstrate is **a language that influences another language by virtue of geographic proximity, not by virtue of its relative prestige**.

#### Native Language Interference
- Native language interference, or transfer, occurs in contact situations, especially with immigration.
- Immigrants' native language influences their second language acquisition, affecting aspects like grammar and vocabulary.
- Interference differs from borrowing as it involves elements of the native language being introduced into the second language.
## 12.1.4 Outcomes of Language Contact

#### Language Convergence
- Occurs when two or more languages become more similar due to extensive, long-term contact.
- Can lead to the formation of a Sprachbund, or union of languages, where several languages show signs of linguistic convergence.
- Example: Balkan Sprachbund in southeastern Europe.

#### Language Shift and Death
- Language shift occurs when a group of speakers adopts another language, abandoning their native language.
- If the shifting group is the only speakers of their original language, language death may occur.
- Example: Many Native American languages in the United States have undergone language death through language shift.

#### Creation of Pidgin, Creole, and Bilingual Mixed Languages
- Pidgin languages arise in trade settings where speakers create a simplified yet distinct language for communication.
- Creole languages emerge when speakers need a common primary means of communication, often in plantation settings.
- Bilingual mixed languages develop in highly bilingual contact situations, combining aspects of two languages.
- Examples include Media Lengua in Ecuador and Michif in Canada, which combine aspects of Spanish/Quechua and Plains Cree/Canadian French respectively.

# 12.3 Pidgin Languages
## 12.3.1 The Development of Pidgin Languages
#### Introduction to Pidgin Languages
- Pidgin languages develop when speakers of mutually unintelligible languages need to communicate but do not share a common language.
- They typically arise in trading centers or industrialized areas attracting people with different native tongues.
- The term "pidgin" is derived from a pidginized form of the English word "business."

#### Characteristics of Pidgin Languages
- Pidgins are not "grammarless" or "broken" versions of other languages but grow and develop over time.
- In the initial stage (prepidgin jargon), there's little consistent grammar and variation among speakers.
- Pidgins become crystallized when they establish grammatical conventions, a necessary characteristic for a pidgin to exist.

#### Development of Pidgin Languages
- Pidgins can develop into two main types:
  - Prototypical pidgins: Emerged abruptly in limited social settings (e.g., trade), with reduced grammar and vocabulary, and are not native to anyone.
  - Expanded pidgins: Not limited to specific social settings, have larger lexical and structural resources, and are as linguistically complex as any other language.
- Pidgins can evolve from prepidgin jargon to prototypical pidgin to expanded pidgin.

## 12.3.2 Common Features of Pidgins

#### Introduction
- Pidgin languages share certain characteristics despite originating from different source languages.
- Some researchers suggest universal strategies of second-language learning play a role in their formation.
- Pidgin formation may involve appeals to language universals.

#### Typical Features of Pidgin Languages
- **Phonology**:
  - Consonant clusters are often reduced, indicating a preference for simpler syllable types.
- **Morphology**:
  - Commonly lacks affixes; words are often uninflected.
  - Pronoun simplification, using a single third-person pronoun.
  - Reduplication as a simple word formation process.
- **Syntax**:
  - Basic word order tends to be subject-verb-object (SVO).
  - Prepositions are used instead of postpositions.
  - Preference for coordinated sentences over subordinate clauses.
  - Articles are generally not used.
  - Aspectual distinctions marked by auxiliaries.
- **Semantics**:
  - Pidgins typically have comparatively small vocabularies, but meanings are often extended.
  - Compounds are more frequent due to limited vocabulary.

These characteristics are illustrated using examples from Cameroonian Pidgin, but similar features are found in pidgins across different regions and languages.

## 12.3.3 Sources of Pidgin Lexicon and Grammar

#### Overview
- Pidgin languages typically comprise elements from all languages in contact.
- Vocabulary often derived from the superstratum language, with the main provider called the lexifier.
- Word order often derived from the dominant language.
- Phonology reflects systems of languages in contact, with influence from substratum languages.
- Syntax is often simplified, making it challenging to identify its base language.
- Pidgins usually have some derivational morphology but lack productive inflectional morphology.

#### Examples:
a. **Chinook Jargon**:
   - Developed in Canada and the northwestern United States as a trade language.
   - Vocabulary primarily from Lower Chinook, with some features from other Native American languages.
   - Later borrowed vocabulary from Canadian French and English.
   - Phonology reflects complexity found in contributing Native American languages.

b. **Tok Pisin**:
   - Spoken in Papua New Guinea, derived mostly from English.
   - Vocabulary examples with phonological and morphological changes from English.
   - Shows influence from Oceanic languages in grammar despite English-derived vocabulary.
   - Expanded pidgins like Tok Pisin evolve from prototypical pidgins to meet communication needs.

#### Conclusion:
- Determining the source of words and grammatical features in pidgins can be challenging.
- Similarities to English or other languages don't always indicate direct derivation.

These examples highlight the complex linguistic dynamics involved in the development of pidgin languages, where multiple languages contribute to vocabulary and grammar.

# 12.4 Creole Languages
## 12.4.1 Social Contexts of Creole Formation

#### Distinction from Pidgins:
- Creoles develop when a primary means of communication is needed, likely becoming the first language of speakers.
- Arise in contexts of intensive contact, often during European colonization, involving enslaved Africans and others.
- Developed by drawing on resources of native languages and colonial languages, with the colonial language typically functioning as the lexifier.

#### Diversity of Creoles:
- Creoles vary widely due to the sociohistorical contexts of their development.
- Factors contributing to diversity include:
  - Languages involved (superstrate and substrate).
  - Proportion of European to African speakers.
  - Access to the lexifier.
  - Stability of the population and language acquisition by children.
- Superstrate acquisition can sometimes lead to a creole being considered a dialect of the lexifier, but in many cases, the resulting variety is distinct.
- Influence from multiple superstrate languages can occur, as seen in Sranan Tongo.
- Creoles can develop from pidgin languages or prepidgin jargon through processes like nativization or repeated second-language acquisition.

#### Role of Language Acquisition:
- Both first- and second-language acquisition play crucial roles in creole development.
- Creole structures often reflect universal aspects of second-language acquisition.
- Creoles provide insight into the origins of language acquisition strategies.

The formation of creole languages is complex and influenced by a range of linguistic, social, and historical factors. Understanding their development sheds light on the dynamics of language contact and acquisition.

## 12.4.2 Creoles in Their Current Social Contexts

#### Full-fledged Languages:
- Creoles are complete languages that have evolved beyond initial perceptions of being "reduced" versions of their lexifiers.
- Despite their independence, they are often marginalized and stigmatized, especially in societies where the lexifier language holds prestige.

#### Creole Continuum:
- Examples like Jamaican Creole demonstrate a continuum of language varieties ranging from standard English to local creole varieties.
- Intermediate varieties along the continuum blur the lines between standard English and creole, with some speakers fluent in multiple varieties.

#### Sociolinguistic Challenges:
- Creoles like Jamaican Patois face exclusion from education and are considered low prestige, affecting speakers' access to opportunities.
- Haitian Kreyòl, despite being the native language of the majority, faces challenges in education and governance due to the dominance of French.
- Efforts such as the MIT-Haiti Initiative aim to address these challenges by promoting technology-enhanced learning and the use of Kreyòl in education.

#### Social Injustices:
- The study of creole languages must also acknowledge the discrimination and social injustices faced by speakers throughout history and in contemporary contexts.

Understanding the social contexts of creole languages is crucial for addressing the challenges faced by speakers and promoting linguistic equity and inclusion.
