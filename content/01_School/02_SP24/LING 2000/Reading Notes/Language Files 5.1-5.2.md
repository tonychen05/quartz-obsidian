# 5.1 Basic Ideas of Syntax
## 5.1.1 (Un)Grammatically
### Syntax and Linguistic Expressions
- **Definition**: Syntax deals with combining words and phrases into larger expressions within grammar.
- **Linguistic Expressions**: 
  - Words (e.g., Bob, cake, out) and phrases (e.g., out the window, my cake, Bob ate my cake).
  - Linguistic expressions possess form, meaning, and syntactic properties.
- **Combination in Syntax**:
  - Syntax determines how expressions combine to form larger ones.
  - Successful combinations result in grammatical expressions; unsuccessful ones are ungrammatical.
- **Examples**:
  - **Grammatical**: Sally likes Bob.
  - **Ungrammatical**: Likes Bob Sally.
- **Grammaticality and Syntactic Well-formedness**:
  - Grammatical expressions are syntactically well-formed; ungrammatical ones are syntactically ill-formed.
- **Grammaticality Judgment**:
  - Native speakers determine whether a string of words forms a sentence in their language.
  - It reflects mental grammar, not necessarily conscious knowledge of prescriptive rules.
- **Considerations**:
  - Judgments based on the ability to utter the string, familiarity, and the behavior of other native speakers.
- **Prescriptive Rules**:
  - Grammaticality judgments focus on natural usage rather than adherence to prescriptive rules.

## 5.1.2 The Relationship between Syntax and Semantics
### Syntax and Semantics Relationship
- **Overview**:
  - Syntax and semantics are distinct but interconnected aspects of language.
  - Syntactic combinations influence the meaning of linguistic expressions.

### Principle of Compositionality
- **Definition**:
  - The meaning of a sentence depends on both its constituent expressions and their syntactic arrangement.
  - Underlies language productivity, allowing for the creation of infinite meaningful sentences.

### Independence of Syntax and Semantics
- **Examples**:
  - **Syntactically Grammatical, Semantically Bizarre**:
    - Example: "Colorless green ideas sleep furiously."
    - Grammatical structure exists despite odd semantic interpretation.
  - **Syntactically Ungrammatical, Semantically Clear**:
    - Example: "*Me bought dog!"
    - Despite syntactic errors, meaning is comprehensible.

### Syntactic Properties vs. Meanings
- **Distinct Behaviors**:
  - **Example 1**: eat vs. devour.
    - Similar meanings but distinct syntactic requirements.
  - **Example 2**: my vs. mine.
    - Similar meanings but differing syntactic behavior.
    
### Cross-Linguistic Variations
- **Observation**:
  - Equivalence in meaning doesn't guarantee syntactic similarity across languages.
- **Example**: English vs. Serbo-Croatian.
  - **Sentence Construction**:
    - Different syntactic requirements despite conveying the same meaning.
- **Conclusion**:
  - Syntactic well-formedness is largely independent of meaning.
  - Syntactic properties must be studied independently.

# 5.2 Syntactic Properties
## 5.2.1 What are Syntactic Properties
### Introduction
- Syntax involves studying how expressions combine.
- Not all combinations are valid; certain restrictions exist.
- Syntactic properties govern the behavior of expressions.
### Types of Syntactic Properties
1. **Word Order**
   - Determines the permissible order of expressions within a sentence.
   - Examines the arrangement of words relative to each other.

2. **Co-occurrence**
   - Focuses on which expressions can or must occur together in a sentence.
   - Explores the relationships between different types of expressions within a sentence.

## 5.2.2 Word Order
### Syntactic Properties: Word Order

#### Overview
- Word order determines the arrangement of expressions within a sentence.
- Deviating from established patterns often leads to ungrammaticality.
#### Common Word Order Patterns
1. **SVO (Subject-Verb-Object)**
   - Example: "Sally walked."
   - Predominant in about 40% of languages.

2. **SOV (Subject-Object-Verb)**
   - Example: "Manasalambaamin’nysavonynylehilahy."
   - Common in about 43% of languages.

3. **VSO (Verb-Subject-Object)**
   - Example: "Ate Sally an apple."
   - Found in about 10% of languages.

#### Variability and Contextual Influence
- Languages often exhibit varied word order patterns in different contexts.
- Example: German's SVO in main clauses vs. SOV in subordinate clauses.

#### Flexibility and Exceptions
- Some languages, like Russian and Dyirbal, allow flexible word order without grammaticality issues.
- English also demonstrates flexibility in certain contexts, such as yes/no questions and topicalization.
### Beyond Word Order
- Syntactic constraints extend beyond mere word order.
- Examples:
  - Positional requirements for determiners (e.g., "these books" vs. "*books these").
  - Constraints on prepositions in relation to noun phrases (e.g., "met with that person" vs. "*met that person with").
  - Distinctions between prepositions and postpositions, as seen in Japanese.
#### Conclusion
- While word order plays a significant role, syntax encompasses more than just arranging expressions in a specific order.
- Various syntactic constraints contribute to the overall well-formedness of a sentence.

## 5.2.3 Co-Occurrence

In addition to word order, another crucial aspect of syntactic well-formedness is the co-occurrence of expressions within a sentence. This section explores how certain expressions necessitate the presence of others and how they interact syntactically.

#### Arguments
- Many expressions have co-occurrence requirements, known as arguments.
- An argument is a necessary component of an expression for the sentence to be grammatical.
- Example: In "Sally devoured an apple," both "Sally" and "an apple" are arguments of "devoured."
- The absence of required arguments leads to ungrammaticality. For instance, "Devoured an apple" lacks a subject.
- Different expressions demand different types of arguments; for example, "devoured" requires an object, while "wondered" requires a prepositional phrase.
- Expressions can have multiple complements; for instance, "Sally told Polly she’s leaving" has two complements: "Polly" and "she's leaving."

#### Adjuncts
- Unlike arguments, adjuncts are optional expressions in a sentence.
- Adjuncts provide additional information but are not necessary for grammaticality.
- Examples include attributive adjectives and adverbial phrases.
- Adjuncts can be added in multiple occurrences and ordered freely within a sentence.
- The same expression can function as an argument or an adjunct depending on its syntactic role in a sentence.
- For instance, "to study French" is an adjunct in "Sally went to France to study French" but an argument in "Sally urged Bob to study French."

#### Agreement
- Expressions may require agreement in terms of morphological features such as number, person, and gender.
- For example, verbs in English show agreement with their subjects in number ("likes" with singular subjects, "like" with plural subjects).
- Demonstratives also exhibit agreement with nouns in number.
- Grammatical gender, present in some languages, can affect agreement patterns. It may not correlate with natural gender and varies across languages.
- Grammatical gender systems classify nouns into different categories arbitrarily.
- Morphological features influence syntactic properties, leading to tight interactions between morphology and syntax referred to jointly as **morphosyntax**.
