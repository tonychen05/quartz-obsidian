# 2.3 Articulation: English Vowels
## 2.3.1 Articulatory Properties of Vowels
- Vowels are the most sonorant and audible sounds in speech, often serving as syllable nuclei.
- Unlike consonants, vowels lack specific place or manner of articulation and are almost always voiced.
- The audibility of consonants surrounding vowels depends on the vowel itself.
**Jaw Movement and Vowel Classification:**
- Vowels are characterized by the jaw and tongue movements during pronunciation.
- Example: The open jaw and low tongue position in [hA] classify [A] as a low vowel.
- Contrast: [i] and [u] are high vowels due to the tongue's proximity to the roof of the mouth.
**Vocal Fold Vibration and Resonance:**
- Vowel sounds originate from vocal fold vibration, with the vocal tract acting as an acoustic resonator.
- The shape of the vocal tract determines vowel quality (e.g., [i], [u], [A]).
**Four Ways to Change Vowel Quality:**
- Speakers can alter vowel quality by:
	- Raising or lowering the body of the tongue.
	- Advancing or retracting the body of the tongue.
	- Rounding or not rounding the lips.
	- Using tense or lax gestures.
**Types of English Vowels:**
- Broadly categorized into monophthongs (single-part vowels) and diphthongs (two-part vowels).
- Discussion of monophthongs' articulation, with diphthongs covered in the subsequent section.

## 2.3.2 Tongue Height
- Tongue position is a key aspect of vowel articulation, with the highest point defining the vowel's place.
- Vowel sounds like [i], [E], [{] in seat, set, sat demonstrate varying degrees of mouth openness corresponding to tongue height.
**High, Mid, and Low Vowels:**
- High vowels ([i], [I], [u], [U]) have a raised tongue, resulting in less open front of the mouth.
- Low vowels ([æ], [A]) involve an open front of the mouth with a lowered tongue.
- Mid vowels ([E], [], [O]) maintain an intermediate tongue height.
**Unstressed Vowels and Dialect Variations:**
- Unstressed vowels in English often shift to the mid vowel [@].
- American dialects may exhibit variations in vowel pronunciation, such as [O] and [A] in caught and cot.
- Some speakers pronounce caught and cot differently, while others pronounce them the same, using [A].
**Common Examples:**
- Examples of vowel sounds in words like leak, lick, Luke, look ([i], [I], [u], [U]) for high vowels, and cat, cot ([æ], [A]) for low vowels.
- Mid vowels illustrated in words like bet, but, bought ([E], [ ], [O]).

## 2.3.3 Tongue Advancement
In addition to high, mid, or low positions, the tongue's forward or backward movement within the oral cavity is crucial in vowel articulation.
- Illustration: High front vowel [i] in beat involves raising and pushing the tongue forward under the hard palate.
- Example: High back vowel [u] in boot is formed by raising the tongue in the back toward the velum.
**Front and Back Monophthongs:**
- Front monophthongs ([i], [I], [E], [{]) involve advancing the tongue forward, as in seek, sick, sec, sack.
- Back monophthongs ([u], [U], [O], [A]) require retracting or pulling back the tongue, as in ooze, look, draw, dot.
**Central Vowels:**
- Central vowels ([], [@]) like luck or the first vowel in another do not require advancement or retraction of the tongue.
**Key Examples:**
- High front vowel [i] and high back vowel [u] serve as examples of how tongue advancement varies in different vowel sounds.
- Front monophthongs ([i], [I], [E], [{]) and back monophthongs ([u], [U], [O], [A]) exemplify tongue movement characteristics.

## 2.3.4 Lip Rounding
- Vowel quality also depends on lip position. 
- When you say the [u] in two, your lips are rounded. For the [i] in tea, they are unrounded, or spread. American English has three rounded monophthongs: [u], [U], [O], as in loop, foot, paw; all other monophthongs are unrounded. In the vowel chart in (1), the rounded vowels are enclosed by the dashed line.

## 2.3.5 Tenseness
**Tense vs. Lax Vowels:**
- Tense vowels exhibit more extreme tongue and/or lip positions than lax vowels.
- Tense vowels require larger changes from a mid-central position in the mouth to reach the outer edges of the possible vowel space.

**Tongue and Lip Positions:**
- Example: Tense high front vowel [i] has a higher and more front position than the lax high front vowel [I].
- Comparison: Tense rounded vowel [u] in boot involves more and tighter lip rounding than the lax counterpart [U] in put.
  
**Vowel Chart Distances:**
- The vowel chart in (1) illustrates that the distance between tense vowels [i] and [u] is greater than between lax vowels [I] and [U].
  
**Duration Difference:**
- Tense vowels in English typically have a longer duration (in milliseconds) than lax vowels.

**Sample Descriptions:**
- Sample descriptions of English vowels based on four characteristics:
	a. [i], as in beat, is high, front, unrounded, and tense.
	b. [O], as in caught or thaw, is mid, back, rounded, and lax.
	c. [A], as in cot, is low, back, unrounded, and lax.
	d. [], as in cut, is mid, central, unrounded, and lax. ("Central" and "mid" refer to the same general area in the vocal tract but along different dimensions.)

## 2.3.6 Describing Vowels: Diphthongs
**Diphthongs vs. Monophthongs:**
- Diphthongs are complex vowel sounds, composed of two parts, transitioning from one vowel to another in the same syllable.
- Contrasted with monophthongs, which are simple vowel sounds.

**Representation of Diphthongs:**
- Diphthongs, despite having two articulations and corresponding vowel sounds, are considered one sound, similar to affricates.
- Example: The diphthong in "buy" is represented as [AI] ([bAI]).
  
**Analysis of Diphthong in "Eye":**
- Observation: The diphthong in "eye" involves a transition from the low back position for [A] to the high front position for [I].
- Perception Aid: Placing a finger on the tongue while saying "eye" can help feel the upward tongue movement.

**Examples of Diphthongs:**
- Analysis of diphthongs in words like "bow" ([bAU]), "boy" ([OI]), and "bay" ([eI]).
- Illustration: The chart in (4) visually represents the tongue movements in the production of these diphthongs.
  
**Diphthongs in Various Words:**
- Description of tongue movements in producing diphthongs in words like "bow" (down), "boy," and "bay."
  
**Visual Reference:**
- Reference to the chart in (4) for a visual representation of the tongue movements involved in the production of the mentioned diphthongs.

## 2.3.7 Investigating Vowel Articulations
**Limitations of Palatography for Vowels:**
- Palatography methods described in Section 2.2.6, used for consonants, are not effective for studying vowel articulations.
- Vowels are produced with a relatively open vocal tract, and the tongue does not touch the roof of the mouth.

**Imaging Techniques for Vowel Study:**
- Investigating vowels requires imaging techniques allowing visualization of the entire mouth and tongue position.
- Traditional X-ray movies of people talking, once used, are no longer employed due to potential harm to speakers.

**Safe Imaging Alternatives:**
- Modern methods for studying vowel articulations include ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and electromagnetic articulography (EMA).
- Ultrasound and MRI use invisible rays (sound waves for ultrasound, radio waves for MRI) to create visual images of tongue, lip, and jaw movements.
- EMA involves placing sensors on articulators, transmitting data to a computer about their relative locations for precise information on articulator movements.

**Safety Concerns and Advantages:**
- X-ray movies, although informative, were discontinued due to potential harm, leading to the adoption of safer and more advanced techniques.
- These techniques are versatile and can also be used for studying consonant articulations, especially for consonants produced without contact on the hard palate (e.g., [b] or [g]).
- Particularly useful for studying the interaction of consonants and vowels in running speech.
