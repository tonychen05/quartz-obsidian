# 4.3 Morphological Types of Languages
## 4.3.1 Classifying Languages by Morphological Type
**Introduction:**
- Consideration of various processes for word formation: 
- Affixation
- Compounding
- Reduplication
- Alternation
- Templatic or suprasegmental morphology
- Morphological metathesis
**Variety in Language Usage:**
- Some languages utilize multiple processes.
- Others use very few.
- Some languages do not use any morphological processes.
**Classification:**
- Two basic morphological types:
- Analytic
- Synthetic
**Subtypes of Synthetic Morphology:**
- Synthetic morphology comprises several subtypes.
## 4.3.2 Analytic Languages
**Definition:**
- Comprised of sequences of free morphemes.
- Each word consists of a single morpheme, maintaining meaning and function independently.
- Purely analytic languages are also known as isolating languages.
**Characteristics:**
- Do not use affixes for word composition.
- Express semantic and grammatical concepts through separate words.
**Example: Mandarin Chinese:**
- Highly analytic structure.
- Plurality and past tense communicated through invariant function words rather than affixes.
**Illustrative Examples:**
- Example sentences demonstrate the use of function words in Mandarin to convey concepts:
	1. "I play piano. (wo tan ganqin)"
	2. "I plural play piano past. (wo men tan ganqin le)" 
**Functional Word Usage in Mandarin:**
- The form of words remains constant regardless of their function in the sentence.
- Example: "We" remains [wɔ mən] whether used as subject or object.
**Comparison with English:**
- Unlike English, where personal pronouns change form based on function (e.g., "we" to "us").
- Similarity with English in using word order to convey noun functions in a sentence.
**Morphological Marking:**
- Nouns in both English and Mandarin are not marked by affixes to show function.
- Function differences signaled solely by word order in both languages.
**Note:**
- Prototypical analytic languages employ no morphological processes at all.
## 4.3.3 Synthetic Languages
**Definition:**
- Bound morphemes attached to other morphemes within a word.
- Words composed of multiple meaningful elements.
**Types of Bound Morphemes:**
- Derivation: Alters meaning or lexical category of the stem.
- Inflection: Indicates grammatical function of the stem in a sentence.
**Stem in Synthetic Languages:**
- Refers to the part of the word to which affixes are added.
- Can consist of one or more morphemes.
**Example: Hungarian:**
- Synthetic language.
- Bound morphemes indicate grammatical functions of nouns.
**Illustrative Examples:**
1. "The man sees the dog."
2. "The dog sees the man."
**Distinctive Feature of Hungarian:**
- Noun phrases marked with bound morphemes, indicating subject or object.
- Position of noun phrase relative to the verb doesn't affect its function.
**Examples in Hungarian:**
- Both examples convey the same meaning despite different noun phrase positions.
- Noun phrases marked with suffix ([t]) if they are the direct object.
**Usage of Bound Morphemes in Hungarian:**
- Indicate concepts like personal possession and location.
- Examples:
	1. "Our house is green."
	2. "Your chair is in our house."
## 4.3.4 The First Type of Synthetic Language: Agglutinating Languages
**Definition:**
- Agglutination: Synthesis of morphemes where they are joined relatively loosely.
- Morphemes and boundaries between them are easily identifiable.
**Example: Hungarian:**
- Demonstrates agglutination.
- Morphemes joined together in a relatively loose manner.
**Illustrative Examples:**
1. "[ha:z-unk-bɔn]" - "house-our-in"
2. "[ha:z-ɔd-bɔn]" - "house-your-in"
3. "[ha:z-unk]" - "house-our"
4. "[ha:z-ɔd]" - "house-your"
**Swahili as Another Example:**
- Verb stems in Swahili take inflectional prefixes to indicate person and tense.
- Examples:
1. "[ni-na-soma]" - "I-present-read"
2. "[u-na-soma]" - "you-present-read"
3. "[a-na-soma]" - "s/he-present-read"
4. "[ni-li-soma]" - "I-past-read"
5. "[u-li-soma]" - "you-past-read"
6. "[a-li-soma]" - "s/he-past-read"
7. "[ni-ta-soma]" - "I-future-read"
8. "[u-ta-soma]" - "you-future-read"
9. "[a-ta-soma]" - "s/he-future-read"
**Characteristics of Agglutinating Languages:**
- Each bound morpheme typically carries only one meaning.
- Example: "ni" = "I," "u" = "you," "a" = "s/he," "na" = "present," etc.
## 4.3.5 The Second Type of Synthetic Language: Fusional Languages
**Definition:**
- Fusional languages, a subtype of synthetic language, form words by adding bound morphemes to stems.
- Unlike agglutinating languages, affixes in fusional languages may not be easily separable from the stem.
- Affixes are fused with the stem, and there are often alternations to forms of both the stems and affixes.
**Example: Spanish:**
- Spanish is a fusional language with inflectional suffixes attached to verb stems.
- These suffixes indicate person, number, and tense of the subject of the verb.
**Characteristics of Fusional Languages:**
- Difficulty in isolating stem and suffix due to fusion.
- Affixes in fusional languages often convey multiple meanings simultaneously.
**Illustrative Examples from Spanish:**
1. "hablo" - "I am speaking"
2. "habla" - "s/he is speaking"
3. "hablé" - "I spoke"
**Analysis of Spanish Verb Forms:**
- Morphemes can be isolated:
- "[-o]" - first-person singular present tense
- "[-a]" - third-person singular present tense
- "[-é]" - first-person singular past tense
- However, the stem "habl-" [aβl] never appears in isolation in Spanish.
**Comparison with Agglutinating Languages:**
- While in agglutinating languages one meaning is usually indicated by each affix, in fusional languages, a single affix often conveys several meanings simultaneously.
**Further Examples from Russian:**
- In Russian, affixes may indicate person, number, and tense simultaneously.
- Example: "[-jɛt]" - third person, singular, present tense ("s/he is reading")
**Comparison with Swahili:**
- In Swahili, person and tense are signaled by separate affixes.
## 4.3.6 The Third Type of Synthetic Language: Polysynthetic Languages
**Definition:**
- In polysynthetic languages, complex words are formed by combining several stems and affixes.
- Nouns (subjects, objects, etc.) are integrated into verb forms.
**Example: Sora:**
- Sora language spoken in India exhibits polysynthesis.
- Incorporates objects (subjects, instruments, etc.) into verbs.
**Illustrative Examples from Sora:**
1. "[aninɲamjɔten]" - "He is fish-catching"
 - Morpheme breakdown: [anin - ɲam - jɔ - te - n]
2. "[ɲamkɪdtenai]" - "I will tiger-catch"
 - Morpheme breakdown: [ɲam - kɪd - te - n - ai]
**Comparison with English:**
- Polysynthetic constructions in Sora are similar to English constructions like "baby-sit" or "trout-fish."
- However, polysynthetic constructions may be more complex, incorporating several nouns and affixes.
**Further Examples from Sora:**
1. "[pɔpoʊŋkoʊntam]" - "(Someone) will stab you with a knife in (your) belly"
 - Morpheme breakdown: [pɔ - poʊŋ - koʊn - t - am]
2. "[ɲɛnəd͡ʒd͡ʒadarsiəm]" - "I will not receive cooked rice from your hands"
 - Morpheme breakdown: [ɲɛn - əd͡ʒ - d͡ʒa - dar - si - əm]
**Distinctive Features of Polysynthetic Languages:**
- Incorporated or "built-in" form of nouns may differ from their free forms.
- Allomorphs seen in polysynthetic constructions.
**Language Typology Continuum:**
- Languages can be more accurately described as residing along a continuum between analytic and synthetic.
- Boundaries between typological categories are often not clear-cut.
**Evolution of Languages:**
- Languages can change over time.
- English, for example, has transitioned from being more synthetic (Old English) to more analytic, but still retains fusional features.
