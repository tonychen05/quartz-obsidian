# 3.1 Phonotactic Constraints and Foreign Accents
## 3.1.1 Phonotactic Constraints
**Introduction to Language Sounds as a System:** While Chapter 2 focused on individual sounds, this chapter explores how sounds work together as a system in a language. Questions about the order of sounds in a word, variations in sound production, and the influence of sounds on each other are discussed.

**Phonotactic Constraints:** Languages have restrictions on sound sequences in different positions within a word, particularly at the beginning and end. These restrictions are known as phonotactic constraints and contribute to the distinctiveness of languages.

**Differences Beyond Phonetic Inventories:** Languages can sound different even with similar phonetic inventories. The rules governing sound sequences play a significant role in making languages distinct.

**English Consonant Constraints:** English permits any consonant to occur word-initially except for [Z] and [ŋ]. Various two-consonant combinations, including stops and fricatives followed by liquids or glides, are allowed.

**Syllable Types:** Languages also have constraints on syllable types. English allows up to three consonants at the beginning of a word under specific conditions. Other languages, such as Hawaiian, Indonesian, and Hebrew, have different constraints on syllable structures.

**Handling Phonotactic Problems:** Languages seek to overcome phonotactic issues when borrowing foreign words. Examples from English, Japanese, and Finnish show different strategies, including dropping or inserting vowels to conform to the language's syllable structure.

**Japanese Vowel Insertion:** Japanese uses vowel insertion as a predictable and rule-governed strategy to adapt borrowed words. For instance, [o] is inserted after [t] and [d], while the high back unrounded vowel [ɯ] is inserted after other consonants.

**Examples of Borrowed Words:** Examples from English, Japanese, and Finnish illustrate how borrowed words may be altered to fit the phonotactic constraints of the borrowing language.

## 3.1.2 Phonetic Constraints in Signed Languages
**Constraints in Signed Languages:** Similar to spoken languages, signed languages have constraints on segment combinations. Constraints on handshapes, movements, and their combinations vary from one signed language to another.

**ASL Syllable Structure:** In American Sign Language (ASL), syllables have a minimum requirement—monosyllabic signs cannot consist of one unchanging handshape, location, and orientation. At least one of these elements must change during the sign to form a grammatical syllable.

**Handshape Changes in ASL:** Handshape changes in ASL may occur during movement from one location to another within a sign. However, if a sign involves movement, handshape changes must take place during the movement and cannot occur while the hands are held at a specific location before or after the movement.

**Constraints on Segments in Signed Languages:** Similar to spoken languages, signed languages have constraints on which segments can appear next to each other. Certain handshapes, though part of the language's system, may not be allowed to appear adjacent within a word.

**Primary Articulators in Signed Languages:** Signed languages have a unique constraint related to the primary articulators—the right and left hands. A signer may be right-hand dominant or left-hand dominant. If both hands are moving, the non-dominant hand must mirror exactly the handshape, orientation, and motion of the dominant hand.

**Symmetry Constraint:** In signed languages, when both hands are moving, a symmetry constraint requires that the non-dominant hand has the same handshape, orientation, and motion as the dominant hand. The direction of the motion may be parallel or anti-parallel.

**Example from ASL:** The ASL sign for 'CAN' illustrates the symmetry constraint, where the non-dominant hand mirrors the shape, orientation, and movement of the dominant hand.

**Exceptions in Signed Codes:** Signed codes, like Signed Mandarin (a signed code for Mandarin Chinese), may have exceptions to universal rules observed in signed languages. For instance, signs introduced by non-native signers may violate constraints, leading to ungrammatical signs in the native signed language.

**Comparison to Language Borrowing:** Attempts to introduce signs from Signed Mandarin into Taiwan Sign Language by non-native signers were met with resistance, similar to introducing unfamiliar words into a spoken language. Native signers rejected the signs as not fitting the constraints of their language.

## 3.1.3 Foreign Accents
**Application of Phonotactic Constraints in Foreign Accents:** Foreign accents often arise when speakers apply the phonotactic constraints of their native language while speaking another. For example, a Spanish speaker may pronounce "student" as [estudent] because the consonant clusters [st], [sk], and [sp] are not permitted at the beginning of a word without being preceded by a vowel in Spanish.

**Differences in Phonetic Inventories:** Another source of foreign accents is the differences in phonetic inventories between languages. Non-native speakers may substitute sounds from their native language when pronouncing words in a foreign language. For instance, French speakers might replace [ð] and [T] with [z] and [s] respectively, and [I] with [i], as these sounds are not present in French.

**Sound Substitution:** Sound substitution occurs when speakers replace non-native sounds with sounds from their native language. This often involves using the most similar sound available in their inventory. Similar effects can be observed in suprasegmentals, where speakers use patterns of stress or intonation from their native language when speaking a foreign language.

**Foreign Accents in Signed Languages:** Speakers of signed languages can also have foreign accents, where they carry over features like handshape and movement from their first language to a second signed language.

**Example from German Pronunciation in English:** German pronunciation by English speakers provides an example of sound substitution. German has a voiceless velar fricative [x], which is lacking in English. English speakers often substitute [k] for [x] in German words, such as pronouncing "Bach" as [bAk] instead of [bAx].

**Phonotactic Constraints Organize Phonetic Inventories:** Phonotactic constraints play a crucial role in organizing phonetic inventories into phonological systems. They determine the allowed combinations of sounds within a language, influencing the pronunciation and contributing to foreign accents.

# 3.2 Phonemes and Allophones

## 3.2.1 Different Sounds Have Different Distributions
**Phonotactic Restrictions:** Languages have restrictions on which sounds can occur in certain environments. The example of [ŋæg] is used to illustrate the difficulty in pronouncing a sequence where [ŋ] occurs at the beginning of a word, which is a phonotactic restriction in English.

**Predictions based on Distribution:** The distributional pattern of sounds in a language allows predictions. For example, an English speaker may struggle with a word beginning with [ŋ] in a foreign language and may replace it with [n].

**Voicing Difference in English:** The voicing difference between the oral velar stops [k] and [g] in English is meaningful. Changes in voicing change the word produced. However, there are no specific restrictions on where [k] and [g] may appear in English words.

**Comparison with Kikamba:** Kikamba, a Bantu language spoken in Kenya, has [k] and [g] in its phonetic inventory. However, the distribution of these sounds in Kikamba differs from English. In Kikamba, the voiced velar stop [g] is restricted and only occurs after the velar nasal [ŋ].

**Meaningful Difference in Kikamba:** Unlike English, the difference between [k] and [g] is not meaningful in Kikamba. Changing the sound after [ŋ] does not alter the word or meaning.

**Illustrative Example in Kikamba:** The example of the word "katala" in Kikamba demonstrates the distributional pattern, where [k] occurs at the beginning, but [ŋk] sequences are not permitted. Changing [k] to [ŋk] does not change the meaning in Kikamba.

## 3.2.2 Allophones and Phonemes
**Perceived Sound Variants as Phonemes:** In every language, certain sounds are perceived as variants of the "same" sound, forming phonemes. An example is provided in Kikamba, where the voicing difference between [k] and [g] is not meaningful, and they are considered variants of the same sound.

**English Sound Variants and Phonetic Transcription:** English has similar relationships between different sounds, illustrated with the words "top," "stop," "little," and "kitten." While most people might perceive them as having the same 't' sound, a phonetic transcription reveals variations ([t], [ɾ], and [?]). Despite these differences, native English speakers consider them the "same" sound at a psychological level.

**Aspiration and Meaning in English:** The distinction between aspirated and non-aspirated stops (e.g., [t] and [t}]) in English, marked by aspiration, is discussed. However, the difference is not meaningful in terms of word distinction, and native English speakers often have difficulty hearing these as different sounds.

**Contrastive vs. Noncontrastive Sounds:** The contrast between aspirated and unaspirated stops in English is noncontrastive, as interchanging them does not change the word's meaning. In Hindi, however, the same distinction is contrastive, affecting the meaning of words.

**Phoneme and Allophone Distinction:** The concept of phoneme and allophone is introduced. A **phoneme** is an abstract psychological category representing a set of speech sounds perceived as the "same," while **allophones** are the actual phonetic segments produced by speakers. Allophones are the concrete, observable level, while phonemes are abstract and not directly observable.

**Phonological System Levels:** The phonological system of a language has two levels – the concrete level of allophones and the abstract level of phonemes. Allophones are physically pronounced in everyday speech, while phonemes are abstract representations stored in the mind.

**Native Speaker's Knowledge of Phonemes:** Native speakers demonstrate their knowledge of phonemes through slips of the tongue and spelling systems. Slips of the tongue reveal that phonemes function as single units of sound, and alphabetic spelling systems often represent phonemes rather than phonetic segments.

**Importance of Phonemes:** Phonemes are significant linguistic units, just like words or sentences, and they play a crucial role in native speakers' language knowledge and production.

## 3.2.3 Identifying Phonemes and Allophones: The Distribution of Speech Sounds
**Distribution of Sounds:** The distribution of a sound refers to the set of phonetic environments in which it occurs, including the sounds that come before and after it in a word. For instance, nasalized vowels in English occur only before nasal consonants.

**Contrastive Distribution:** Sounds have a contrastive distribution when they occur in the same phonetic environment, and using one instead of the other changes the word's meaning. An example is provided with [p] and [ph] in Hindi, where they give rise to different words in the same environment.

**Minimal Pairs:** Minimal pairs, two words with different meanings that differ by exactly one aspect of pronunciation, indicate contrastive distribution. For instance, [p}@l] 'fruit' and [p@l] 'moment' are minimal pairs in Hindi, showing that [p] and [ph] are contrastive.

**Complementary Distribution:** Sounds are in complementary distribution when they do not occur in the same phonetic environments. Their distributions complement each other, meaning they fill different roles in the language. Complementary distribution implies that the sounds are perceived as variants of the same sound (allophones). There are no minimal pairs for sounds in complementary distribution.

**Predictability of Distribution:** In complementary distribution, the appearance of allophones in specific contexts is predictable. For example, nasalized vowels in English always occur before nasal consonants ([~] appears before [n, m]), and [i] and [~] have complementary distribution.

**Examples of Complementary Distribution in English:** The sounds [i] and [~] in English and [p] and [p}] are presented as examples of complementary distribution. Their distributions do not overlap, and there are no minimal pairs involving a contrast between them.

**Generalization to Other Languages:** The concept of complementary distribution is not limited to English. Examples from Kikamba demonstrate how sounds like [k] and [g] can be allophones of the same phoneme in complementary distribution in another language.

**Summary of Contrastive and Complementary Distribution:** The table (7) summarizes the differences between sounds in contrastive distribution (allophones of different phonemes) and sounds in complementary distribution (allophones of the same phoneme) based on predictability, minimal pairs, and their relation to phonemes.

## 3.2.4 Free Variation
**Overlap in Distribution:** Sounds that can occur in the same phonetic environments are said to be in overlapping distribution. This includes both contrastive and complementary distribution.

**Free Variation:** In some cases, more than one pronunciation of a sound may be possible without changing the word's meaning. Such sounds are in free variation, where the choice between pronunciations does not affect the word's meaning. An example is given with the sounds [p] and [p] at the ends of words like "leap."

**Characteristics of Free Variation:** Free variation involves sounds that are interchangeable without creating minimal pairs. The choice between sounds in free variation is not predictable, and both pronunciations are perceived as the "same" sound. Native speakers consider them allophones of the same phoneme.

**Contrastive Overlapping Distribution:** Sounds like [d] and [t] in English are in overlapping distribution because they can occur in the same environments, as seen in minimal pairs like "lid" [lId] and "lit" [lIt]. However, their occurrence in the same environment creates a minimal pair, distinguishing them as allophones of different phonemes.

**Noncontrastive Overlapping Distribution:** Sounds like [t] and [t] in English are in overlapping distribution because they can occur in the same phonetic environment, such as after [lI] at the end of a word. However, they do not create minimal pairs, and the choice between them does not affect the word's meaning. They are allophones of the same phoneme.

**Summary of Characteristics:** The table (9) summarizes the characteristics of contrastive distribution, complementary distribution, and free variation. It includes how to identify them, the predictability of distribution, and their relation to phonemes.

**Extended Table:** The table is extended to include free variation as a distinct category, emphasizing the differences between noncontrastive overlapping distribution with free variation and noncontrastive complementary distribution.

**Explanation of Examples:** Examples are provided to illustrate the concepts, such as the distinction between [lIt] and [lIt] in English. While both are valid pronunciations, [t] and [t] are in free variation, unlike [ph] and [p], which are in complementary distribution.
