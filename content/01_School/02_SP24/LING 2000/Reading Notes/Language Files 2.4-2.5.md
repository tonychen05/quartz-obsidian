# 2.4 Beyond English: Speech Sounds of the World's Languages

## 2.4.1 Beyond English?
- Phonetic alphabet in the book applicable to any language.
- Acknowledgment that current phonetic alphabet parts may appear Anglocentric.
- Aim to "de-anglicize" the alphabet for universal use in describing other languages' pronunciation.
- Not the goal of the file to cover all speech sounds; focus on common phonetic symbols.
- English represents only a small subset of the potential sounds in human language.
- Use the IPA chart to interpret unfamiliar symbols.

## 2.4.2 Vowels
- Filling in gaps in the phonetic alphabet for more comprehensive coverage of sounds.
- English has specific rounded vowels [u], [U], [O], and diphthong [oU].
- Other possible vowel sounds exist, not occurring in English due to specific feature combinations.
- German and French introduce front rounded vowels like [y] and [ø].
- Description of the tongue positions and lip rounding for high front rounded vowel [y] and mid front rounded vowel [ø].
- Distinction between [A] and [a] in languages other than English, representing low back unrounded and central/front low unrounded vowels.
- Introduction of **oral and nasalized vowels**. Nasalized vowels are identical to oral vowels, except the velum is lowered and the nasal passage is open.
- **Nasalized vowels** represented with a tilde [~] over the corresponding oral vowel symbol (e.g., [e~], [o~]).
- Nasalized vowels exemplified in French, where nasalization serves as a distinguishing feature between words.

## 2.4.3 Fricatives
- Focus on the fricative row of the English consonant chart.
- Seven empty cells in this row: **bilabial voiceless and voiced**, **palatal voiceless** and **voiced**, **velar voiceless and voiced**, and **glottal voiced**.
	- All seven sounds in these cells occur in other languages.
- Introduction of symbols for these fricatives shown in (3).
- English does not contrast voiced and voiceless glottal fricatives, but voiced glottal fricative [] occurs when 'h' sound is between vowels (e.g., ahead).
- Co-articulation influences pronunciations, such as the palatal [ç] in words like "huge" at the beginning.
- Theoretical ease in producing other fricatives as they combine features existing in English.
- Introduction of non-English fricatives: bilabial [F], voiceless velar [x], voiced bilabial [β], and voiced velar [γ].
- Examples of these sounds in German, Yiddish, Mandarin Chinese, and Spanish.

## 2.4.4 Filling in Other Blanks in the Consonant Chart
- Focus on filling empty cells in the English consonant chart.
- Affricate row example: English has post-alveolar affricates, but other possibilities exist.
- Introduction of voiceless alveolar affricate [ts] in Canadian French and voiceless labial affricate [pf] in German.
- Phonetic symbols for these sounds aid in pronunciation, building on knowledge of [t], [s], [p], and [f].
- Mention of **palatal** sounds, including the palatal glide [j].
- Some languages use palatal stops and nasals; example of voiceless palatal stop [c] in Greek and voiced palatal nasal [] in Spanish and Italian.
- Palatal sounds involve the middle of the tongue pressing into the roof of the mouth, distinguishing them from sounds like [k] or [ŋ].
- Illustration of contrasting pronunciations of English words: key ([ci]) and coo ([ku]).
- **Introduction of four new sounds**: voiceless alveolar affricate [ts], voiceless labial affricate [pf], voiceless palatal stop [c], and voiced palatal nasal [].

## 2.4.5 Other Types of Articulation
- Focus on non-English sounds represented in the phonetic alphabet.
- Introduction of consonants with places of articulation not found in English.
	- postalveolar types
		- palato-alveolar
		- retroflex
		- alveolo-alveolar
	- retroflex
	- uvular
	- pharyngeal
- Example of voiceless uvular stop [q] in Farsi, seen in the word [q{dri] meaning 'a little bit.'
- Description of uvular stops produced by making a stop closure between the back of the tongue and the uvula, similar to [k] but with the tongue pulled farther back.
- Voiced counterpart of [q] is [G].
- Introduction of voiceless pharyngeal fricative [] in Maltese and voiced pharyngeal fricative [ʕ] in some dialects of Hebrew.
- Description of the pharyngeal place of articulation, located further back and lower in the vocal tract compared to the uvula.
- Ease in producing a pharyngeal fricative by starting with the vowel [A] of "father" and widening the jaw to pull the tongue back, causing a frication noise.

# 2.5 Suprasegmental Features
## 2.5.1 Segmental vs. Suprasegmental Features
- Introduction to **suprasegmental** features: **length**, **intonation**, **tone**, and **stress**.
- Suprasegmental features are considered to "ride on top of" segmental features.
- Suprasegmental features are challenging to identify in a single segment; comparison across different segments and utterances is necessary.

## 2.5.2 Length
- Length is the first suprasegmental feature discussed.
- One additional diacritic for length **[:]**
- Speech sounds may have varying durations, but it's challenging to identify the length of a segment in isolation.
- In some languages, differences in segment duration are meaningful, influencing word meaning.
- Example from Finnish showing how length contrasts affect word meaning.
- Length is a suprasegmental feature as it requires comparing durations within an utterance.
- Inherently, high vowels are generally shorter than low vowels, and voiceless consonants are often longer than voiced consonants.
- Voiceless fricatives are usually the longest consonants.
- Duration of a speech sound can be influenced by surrounding sounds, demonstrated with examples like "beat" and "bead" in English. Vowel length before a voiced consonant is about 1.5 times longer than before a voiceless consonant. The place and manner of articulation of a following consonant can also affect vowel length.

## 2.5.3 Intonation
- Voiced speech sounds, particularly vowels, may have different pitches, and pitch is the psychological correlate of fundamental frequency.
- Pitch movements across a stretch of speech, such as a sentence, are known as intonation.
- Intonation contour of an utterance plays a role in determining its meaning.
- Example with the sentences "You got an A on the test" and "Yes" to illustrate how different pitch patterns (rising or falling) can change the meaning (question vs. statement).
- Two intonational phenomena: pitch accents and phrase tones.
- Pitch accents involve a change in fundamental frequency in the middle of an utterance, highlighting important information. Not all words receive pitch accents.
- Phrase tones involve changes in fundamental frequency at the end of a phrase instead of in the middle of an utterance.
- Pitch accents and phrase tones contribute to the overall meaning of an utterance and can distinguish between a statement and a question.
- Example sentences to demonstrate the use of pitch accents and phrase tones.
- Sentence-final intonation, with falling pitch, is typical for statements, while question intonation, with rising pitch, is common for yes/no questions.
- Phrase tones group words into linguistic units called phrases, and they can create perceptual breaks in longer utterances.
- Phrase tones are like the "punctuation" of spoken language, indicating breaks between phrases.
- Continuation rise is a pitch pattern that marks the end of a phrase and the speaker's intention to continue speaking.
- Example with the phrase "What's that in the road ahead?" and "What's that in the road? A head?" to show how different phrase tones can lead to different interpretations despite identical phonetic segments.

## 2.5.4 Tone
- In many languages, the pitch at which syllables in a word are pronounced, known as tone, can change the word's meaning. These languages are called tone languages.
- Examples of tone languages include Thai, Mandarin Chinese, Vietnamese, languages in New Guinea (e.g., Skou), Bantu languages in Africa (e.g., Zulu, Yoruba, Igbo), and North and South American Indian languages (e.g., Apache, Navajo, Kiowa, Mazotec, Bora).
- Mandarin Chinese words with the syllable [ma] pronounced with different tones illustrate how tone can alter meanings.
- Tone languages can have level tones (steady tones like high, mid, or low) and contour tones (tones that glide from one level to another, analogous to diphthongs).
- Transcription systems for tones vary, with tone numbers often used for Mandarin, and accent marks over vowels for languages like Kikerewe (Bantu language in Tanzania).
- Tones are at least partially relative, making them suprasegmental features; pitch may vary based on the speaker's voice characteristics.
- Tone and intonation are not mutually exclusive; tone languages use both features.
- Languages may have certain constants in tone production, such as overall higher pitch in Cantonese compared to Taita (a Bantu language in Kenya), providing listeners with a baseline for tonal range expectations.
- Listener knowledge about a speaker's physical characteristics (e.g., gender, height) can aid in correctly identifying tones.
## 2.5.5 Stress
- Stress, a suprasegmental feature, is a property of entire syllables, and the syllable nucleus, usually a vowel, carries most of the information about stress.
- Stressed syllables are more prominent than unstressed ones, characterized by factors such as being longer, louder, and containing full vowels.
- Full vowels, produced with more extreme tongue positions, are found in stressed syllables, while reduced vowels, produced closer to the mid-central position, often occur in unstressed syllables.
- Stress levels in English can vary, illustrated by words like "photography" where the second syllable has primary stress, the final syllable has secondary stress, and other syllables are unstressed.
- IPA transcribes stress using symbols: primary stress is marked with ['], secondary stress with ["], and tertiary stress is not marked.
- Stress placement can be predictable in some languages (e.g., Czech, Welsh, French) but unpredictable in others (e.g., Russian, English), causing differences in meaning.
- Differences in stress placement can be exemplified by phrases like "blackboard" vs. "black board" or "a white house" vs. "the White House."
- Words like "record," "perfect," and "subject" can have different meanings based on stress placement on the first or second syllable.
- Examples like "incite" and "insight" showcase how changing stress placement can result in different meanings.
- Suprasegmental features, including stress, are challenging to transcribe because they are "superimposed" on other features and are crucial in contemporary phonetic research
