# 4.1 Words and Word Formation: The Nature of the Lexicon
## 4.1.1 What Does It Mean to Be a Word
**Lexicon as Mental Dictionary:**
    - Every language has a mental dictionary known as the lexicon.
    - Language users internalize this stock of words.

**Defining Words:**
    - Not all words are equally distinct from each other.
    - Consideration of form and meaning differentiates words.
    - Example: Cat and dog are distinct due to differences in sound and meaning.

**Word Comparison:**
- Comparing similar-sounding words like "cat" and "catalog."
- Phonological form and meaning are both important.
- Example: Despite sharing the /kæt/ sound, "cat" and "catalog" have different meanings.

**Consideration of Phonological Form and Meaning:**
- Words may share elements of form but have distinct meanings.
- Example: "Kid" and "kidney" share sounds but have unrelated meanings.
- Humorous connections between words do not imply relatedness.

## 4.1.2 Derivation
**Word Comparison:**
- Examining the relationship between "cat" and "catty" (meaning 'spiteful').
- Both words share phonological form (/kæt/) and meaning (association with vicious behavior).

**Lexical Categories:**
- Words belong to lexical categories (parts of speech) expressing morphosyntactic features.
- Examples of features include number, case, gender, person, tense, aspect, mood.

**Open and Closed Lexical Categories:**
- Nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs are open categories, acquiring new members.
- Closed categories include pronouns, determiners, prepositions, and conjunctions.
    
**Word Classification:**
- "Cat" (noun) and "catty" (adjective) belong to different lexical categories.
- This distinction indicates they are separate words, despite shared form and meaning.

**Derivation Process:**
- Derivation involves creating new words from existing ones, often changing lexical categories.
- Affixes attach to stems, altering meaning or category.
- Examples: "Playable" (adjective from verb), "replay" (verb from verb), "unkind" (adjective from adjective).
## 4.1.3 Inflection

**Phonological Form Comparison:**
- Comparing "cat" and "cats" reveals a single additional sound (/s/) in the plural form.
- Similar degree of difference observed between "cat" and "catty" (/kæt/ vs. /kæti/).

**Meaning and Lexical Category:**
- Both "cat" and "cats" refer to the same entity but in different quantities (singular vs. plural).
- Both belong to the same lexical category, noun.

**Inflectional Affixes:**
- Inflection involves creating different grammatical forms of words without changing their lexical category.
- Affixes such as -s (plural), -ed (past tense), and -ing (progressive aspect) are examples of inflectional affixes in English.

**Inflection vs. Derivation:**
- Derivation creates new lexemes with altered meanings or lexical categories.
- Examples: "Overdo," "redo," and "undo" are instances of derivation from "do."
- Inflection maintains the same core concept (lexeme) while altering grammatical information.

**Complex Relationship:**
- The distinction between derivation and inflection is not always clear-cut, representing a continuum.
- Some processes may exhibit characteristics of both derivation and inflection.
- Consideration of phonological form, meaning, and lexical category is crucial in analyzing word forms.
## 4.1.4 Some Notes about Morphemes

**Morpheme Definition:**
- *A morpheme is the smallest linguistic unit with meaning or grammatical function.*
- It has a specific phonological form.

**Roots and Affixes:**
- Roots (e.g., "cat") and affixes (e.g., "-ed" for past tense) are morphemes.
- Stems may contain more than one morpheme (e.g., "cattiness").

**Affix Terminology:**
- Suffixes follow a stem, while prefixes precede it.

**Homophonous Affixes:**
- Affixes with the same phonological form but different meanings/functions are homophonous.
- Example: "-er" can mark comparative degree or derive agent nouns.

**Importance of Form and Meaning:**
- Both form and meaning are crucial for analyzing morphological structures.

**False Morphemic Analysis:**
- Some words may appear to contain multiple morphemes but actually don't.
- Example: "Catalog" may seem to contain "cat," "a," and "log," but it's monomorphemic.

**Word Length vs. Morpheme Count:**
- Word length does not necessarily correspond to the number of morphemes.
- Example: "Madagascar," "cucumber," "pumpernickel" are long but monomorphemic, while "ads" is short but bimorphemic.
## 4.1.5 Classifying Elements in Morphology
**Segmentation of Words:**
- Analysis based on form, meaning, and lexical category helps in identifying morphemes.
- Morphemes are the smallest units with meaning or grammatical function.

**Free and Bound Morphemes:**
- Free morphemes (e.g., "cat") can stand alone as words.
- Bound morphemes (e.g., "-ing") must be attached to a word stem to be used.

**Bound Roots:**
- Some roots only appear with affixes attached, known as bound roots.
- Examples include "-fer" (e.g., infer, defer) and "-ceive" (e.g., conceive, deceive).

**Content vs. Function Morphemes:**
- Content morphemes have concrete meaning, while function morphemes primarily convey grammatical information.
- Content morphemes include nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and some affixes.
- Function morphemes include prepositions, determiners, pronouns, conjunctions, and some affixes.
    
**Classification:**
    - **Free Morphemes:**
        - **Content Words:** Nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs.
        - **Function Words:** Prepositions, determiners, pronouns, conjunctions.
    - **Bound Morphemes:**
        - **Bound Roots:** Roots appearing only with affixes.
        - **Affixes:** Derivational and inflectional affixes.

**Complex Classification:**
- The distinction between content and function morphemes is not always straightforward.
- Some morphemes may seem to contradict their classification based on meaning or function.
## 4.1.6 Allomorphy
**Definition:**
- Allomorphy: Variations in the forms of morphemes.
- Allomorphs: Individual variants of morphemes.

**Parallel with Phonology:**
- 

**Distribution:**
- Allomorphs occur in complementary distribution.
- Each allomorph has a specific conditioning environment.

**Phonological Allomorphy:**
- Allomorphs have predictable distribution based on phonetic environment.
- Occurs due to regular phonological processes like assimilation.

**Morphological and Lexical Conditioning:**
- Allomorphy can be conditioned by morphological or lexical context.
- Includes morphosyntactic features, derivational affixes, or specific lexemes.

**Weak Suppletion:**
- Some similarity between allomorphs, but no regular pattern.
- Cannot be derived by a single underlying representation or morphophonemic rule.

**Strong Suppletion:**
- Allomorphs differ significantly in form.
- Common in inflectional forms; treated as part of the same lexeme despite form differences.

**Examples:**
- English verbs ("bring" vs. "brought," "teach" vs. "taught").
- English adjectives ("good" vs. "better" vs. "best," "bad" vs. "worse" vs. "worst").
- Serbo-Croatian noun "cˇovjek" (singular vs. plural forms).

**Frequency:**
- Strong suppletion typically represents a minority class within a language's lexicon.

## 4.1.7 Derived and Inflected Words in the Lexicon

**Formation of New Words:**
- Linguists debate whether every morphologically complex word is reconstructed in the brain each time it's used.
- Some claim that each morpheme is listed individually in the mental lexicon, and words are reconstructed from separate entries.
- However, evidence suggests that some languages store morphologically complex words as separate entries in the lexicon.

**Accessing Morphologically Complex Words:**
- Speakers of a language often access whole morphologically complex words without decomposing them into individual morphemes.
- This suggests that the mental lexicon contains entries for morphologically complex words.

**Derivation as a Process of Word Formation:**
- "Formation" refers to systematic relationships between roots and derived words, as well as between words and their inflected forms.
- Even if speakers don't "build" complex words every time, derivation is still considered a process of word formation.

**Awareness of Relationships:**
- Speakers are often aware of relationships between words and their derived forms.
- New words can be formed based on existing patterns in the lexicon, demonstrating speakers' understanding of these relationships.

**Productivity:**
- Rules that speakers apply to form novel words are called productive.
- English has examples of both nonproductive and productive morphemes.
- Affixes or morphological processes may become more or less productive over time.
