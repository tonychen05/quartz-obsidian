# 13.4 Morphological Change
## 13.4.1 What is Morphological Change
### Morphological Change
- Morphological change refers to changes in the morphological structure of words over time.
- Example: Evolution of the past tense of the verb "climb" from "clomb" to "climbed" in Modern English.

### Competition between Forms
- New forms introduced by morphological changes compete with old forms.
- Results in variation in language usage, such as differences in past tense formations like "fit" vs. "fitted" or "lit" vs. "lighted."

### Synchronic Variation
- Morphological changes contribute to synchronic variation in languages.
- Variation evident in different language communities and groups of speakers.

### Irregular Application
- Morphological change doesn't necessarily apply regularly across the system.
- Changes may be accepted or rejected by speakers on an individual basis.

### Word Formation Processes
- Analogous to fads and fashion, where new words are introduced and may or may not become popular.
- Example: Productive use of the suffix "-age" to form new nouns like "beerage" or "spoilage."

### Social and Regional Acceptance
- Newly formed words may be acceptable only in certain social or regional contexts.
- Not equally known or used by all speakers of English.

## 13.4.2 Proportional Analogy and Paradigm Leveling

#### Regularization through Morphological Change
- The shift from irregular forms to regular ones through analogical change.
- Example: Evolution of the past tense of "climb" from "clomb" to "climbed" follows the regular pattern of adding "-ed" after a voiced consonant.

#### Proportional Analogy
- Analogy involves the influence of one form or group of forms over another.
- Schematized as a four-part proportion: "a : b :: c : X".
- Example: "rhyme : rhym + ed :: climb : climb + ed" leads to "climbed".

#### Paradigm Leveling
- Analogical change within a paradigm.
- Example: Reduction of irregularity or allomorphy among morphologically related forms.
- Case study: Transition in Latin from irregular stem forms to regular forms due to sound changes.

#### Results of Analogical Change
- Regularity is a common outcome.
- Elimination of irregularities and allomorphy within morphological subsystems.
- Not limited to regularization, other outcomes exist.

#### Other Forms of Analogical Change
- Some analogical changes do not primarily aim at regularization.
- Further exploration is needed to understand these nuances.
## 13.4.3 Back Formation and Folk Etymology

#### Back Formation
- Creation of a new stem form by removing a perceived affix.
- Example: "burglar" reanalyzed as "burgle" + "-er" leading to the creation of the verb "burgle".
#### Preceding Reanalysis
- Back formation often preceded by reanalysis.
- Example: Reanalysis of "burglar" as conforming to the pattern of "verb + -er → agent noun" resulting in the creation of "burgle".
#### Influence of Productive Processes
- Productive inflectional processes can also lead to back formations.
- Example: Reanalysis of "cherise" as plural, leading to the creation of a new singular noun "cherry".
#### Folk Etymology
- Reanalysis of obscure morphemes in terms of more familiar ones.
- Example: Substitution of "garden" for "garter" in "garter snake" due to phonological similarity and semantic clarity.
#### Occurrence in Obscure Morphological Cases
- Folk etymology often occurs when the morphological makeup of a word is unclear to speakers.
- Example: Substitution of "groom" for "guma" in "bridegroom" due to phonological similarity and semantic relationship.
#### Examples of Folk Etymology
- Examples include substitutions like "sick-as-hell anemia" for "sickle-cell anemia" and "old-timer's disease" for "Alzheimer's Disease".
#### Characterization of Analogical Change
- Back formation and folk etymology involve the reanalysis of unfamiliar morphemes to make them more accessible.
- Both processes entail the influence of one form or set of forms over another.
## 13.4.4 Adding New Words to a Language

#### Acronyms
- Formed by combining initial sounds or letters of words in a phrase.
- Examples: NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization), laser (light amplification through the stimulated emission of radiation), radar (radio detection and ranging).

#### Blends
- Combination of parts of two words, usually the beginning of one and the end of another.
- Examples: smog (smoke + fog), brunch (breakfast + lunch), chortle (chuckle + snort).

#### Clipping
- Shortening of words without considering derivational morphology.
- Examples: exam (examination), dorm (dormitory), taxi/cab (taxicab).

#### Coinages
- Creation of new words without using existing word parts.
- Examples: Kodak, Exxon, pooch, snob.

#### Conversions
- Creation of new words by shifting the part of speech of an existing word.
- Examples: laugh, run, buy, steal (verbs used as nouns), position, process, contrast (nouns used as verbs).

#### Eponyms
- Words named after persons or figures associated with them.
- Examples: Washington, DC (George Washington), District of Columbia (Christopher Columbus), ohm (Georg Simon Ohm), watt (James Watt).

# 13.5 Syntactic Change
## 13.5.1 Defining Syntactic Change
#### Introduction
- Like other components of language, syntax is subject to change.
- Syntactic change involves alterations in the organization of words and morphemes into phrases and sentences.
#### Primary Data of Syntactic Change
- Historical linguists study changes in syntactic structuring of sentences.
- Examples include changes in word order, use of morphemes indicating relations among words, and changes in arguments of words.
#### Examples of Syntactic Changes
- Changes in word order: e.g., shifts in commands but retention of older patterns in specific expressions.
- Changes in morpheme use: e.g., alterations in agreement markings on verbs or adjectives.
- Changes in arguments of words: e.g., variations in prepositional requirements (e.g., "worthy of consideration").
#### Characteristics of Syntactic Change
- Notably, syntactic change may produce new patterns, but exceptions can occur.
- Unlike sound change's regularity, syntactic changes can have exceptions.
- Changes are often specific to the syntactic properties of particular words.
#### Conclusion
- Syntactic change is a fundamental aspect of language evolution, marked by alterations in the organization and structure of sentences.
## 13.5.2 Changes in Word Order

#### Possessive Determiner Placement
- In earlier stages of English, possessive determiners often followed the noun they modified.
- Example: "fæder ure" for "our father" in Old English.
#### Structural Change in Noun Phrases
- In Old English, one structure for a noun phrase was NP → N + Det.
- Modern English structure: NP → Det + N.
#### Pronoun Placement in Imperative Sentences
- In earlier English, pronoun "you" could appear before or after the verb in imperative sentences.
- Modern English: Pronoun precedes the verb. (e.g., "You go!" vs. "*Go you!"*)
#### Positioning of Main Verbs in Questions and Negatives
- In Modern English, if a statement lacks an auxiliary verb, "do" must be used in forming questions or negative sentences.
- Example comparisons with and without auxiliary verbs:
  - Statement: "she will go"
  - Question: "will she go?"
  - Negative: "she will not go."
- Contrast with Early Modern English where main verbs appeared before the subject in questions and before "not" in negatives.
- Example from Shakespeare's Othello:
  - Early Modern English: "How got she out?" vs. "How did she get out?"
  - "Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters' minds" vs. "Do not trust your daughters' minds."
  - "But though they jump not on a just account" vs. "They do not jump."
## 13.5.3 Changes in Co-Occurrence

#### Grammatical Function Marking
- In Modern English, noun phrases like "our father" have the same form regardless of their function in the sentence (subject or object), indicated by their position in the sentence.
- Example:
  - (subject) "Our father drinks a lot of coffee."
  - (object) "We love our father."
- In Old English, the grammatical function of a noun phrase was signaled by changes in its form:
  - (subject) "fæder ure"
  - (object) "fæder urne"
#### Transition from Case-Marking to Syntactic System
- Transition from a "case-marking" morphological system to a syntactic system based on word order.
#### Adjective Agreement
- In Old English, adjectives agreed with the noun they modified in gender, number, and case.
- In Modern English, remnants of number agreement with adjectives are found with determiners like "this/that" and "these/those".
#### Changes in Co-Occurrence Requirements
- Example with the adjective "worthy":
  - In earlier English, "worthy" regularly occurred with a that-clause following it.
  - Example: "I am not worthy that I be called your son."
  - Modern English: "I am not worthy to be called your son," indicating a change in co-occurrence requirement from that-clauses to infinitival clauses.
## 13.5.4 Causes of Syntactic Change

#### Language-Internal Causes
- Changes in word order in specific syntactic environments are often correlated with other changes in word order.
- Example: Changes in noun + determiner placement correlated with changes in object placement with respect to the verb, relative clause placement with respect to the noun it modifies, noun placement with respect to prepositional elements, etc.
- System-wide changes in the ordering of elements may occur in various syntactic environments.

#### Language-External Causes
- Innovative syntactic patterns compete with older patterns.
- Social factors play a role in deciding the competition between old and new patterns.
- Example: Case-marking distinction involving "who" vs. "whom" in Modern English, where usage may be influenced by speakers' educational level, attitudes toward education, desired impression, etc.

# 13.6 Semantic Change
## 13.6.1 Changing the Meaning of Words

#### Conceptualization of Semantic Change
- Semantic change involves a shift in the set of appropriate contexts or referents for a word's use over time.
- It can be seen as either:
  - A shift in the set of appropriate contexts for word usage.
  - A change in the set of objects the word refers to.
- These perspectives are two aspects of meaning and are equivalent.

#### Motivating Factors
- The factors motivating semantic change are not fully understood.
- Semantic changes may result from:
  - Language contact.
  - Technological innovations.
  - Migrations to new geographic regions.
- Introduction of new objects or concepts into a culture can initiate changes in word meanings.
- Changes in the relative status of the set referred to by a word can also prompt semantic changes.
- Taboo words often undergo semantic changes due to changes in their status.

#### Types of Semantic Changes
- Various types of semantic changes occur with frequency:
  - Extensions.
  - Reductions.
  - Elevations.
  - Degradations.
## 13.6.2 Semantic Extensions
### Semantic Extensions

Semantic extensions occur when the set of appropriate contexts or referents for a word increases. This often involves generalizing from a specific case to a broader class. Here are some examples:

1. **Dog (Old English: docga)**
   - Originally referred to a specific breed of dog.
   - In modern usage, it refers to dogs in general, extending from a specific case to the general class.

2. **Bird**
   - Initially referred to a particular species of bird.
   - Now used for the general class of birds.

3. **Nuke**
   - Originally meant 'to drop a nuclear bomb on something.'
   - Extended to mean 'to damage' or 'to destroy' in some varieties, such as "Robin nuked his Porsche last night."

4. **Proper and Brand Names**
   - Proper names like "Benedict Arnold" have become synonymous with traitor.
   - Brand names like "Jell-O" are used generically for any flavored gelatin.

### Metaphorical Extension

Sometimes, words undergo metaphorical extension, where their meanings are extended to include objects or concepts metaphorically related to the original referent. Examples include:

- **Broadcast**: Originally meant 'to scatter seed over a field,' now refers to the transmission of programs or information via media outlets.
- **Nautical Terms**: Terms like "ship," "navigate," and "crew" applied metaphorically to space exploration.
- **Phoneme**: Originally related to minimal units of sound, now extended to minimal units of form in signed languages.

### Examples in Contemporary Language

Metaphorical extensions can also be found in contemporary language, especially in creative slang terms. For instance, the verb "nuke" used to refer to microwave cooking metaphorically draws a parallel between cooking in a microwave and bombing, though the actions are different. This usage may not be accepted by all speakers yet.

## 13.6.3 Semantic Reductions
#### Definition
- Semantic reductions occur when the set of appropriate contexts or referents for a word decreases over time.
- While less common historically than extensions of meaning, semantic reductions still occur fairly frequently.
#### Examples
1. **Hund (Old English) → Hound (Modern English)**
   - Originally referred to dogs in general.
   - Meaning now restricted mainly to specific breeds of dogs.
   
2. **Worm (Old English)**
   - Initially used for any crawling creature.
   - Meaning now limited to a particular type of crawling creature.

3. **Skyline (Modern English)**
   - Originally referred to the general horizon.
   - Meaning now restricted to specific types of horizons, typically those with outlines of hills, buildings, or structures.

4. **Girl (Modern English)**
   - In Middle English, referred to young people of either sex.
   - Semantic reduction led to its current, more specific meaning referring to young females.

## 13.6.4 Semantic Elevations
#### Definition
- Semantic elevations occur when a word develops grander or more positive connotations over time.

#### Examples
1. **Knight (Old English)**
   - Originally meant 'youth' or 'military follower,' referring to relatively powerless individuals.
   - Meaning elevated to refer to individuals of a more romantic and impressive status.

2. **Chivalrous**
   - Initially synonymous with 'warlike.'
   - Meaning elevated to encompass refined qualities such as fairness, generosity, and honor.

3. **Nice**
   - Borrowed into Middle English from Old French meaning 'foolish' or 'ignorant' (from Latin "nescius," meaning 'not-knowing').
   - Over centuries, the meaning shifted dramatically to 'pleasant,' 'agreeable,' 'kind,' and 'well-done' in Modern English.

## 13.6.5 Semantic Degradation
Semantic degradations occur when a word's meaning becomes more negative or pejorative over time. Here are some examples:

1. **Lust**
   - In Old English, "lust" simply meant 'pleasure.'
   - Its current association with sinfulness represents a degradation of the original meaning.

2. **Wench**
   - Originally meant 'female child' in Middle English.
   - Later came to mean 'female servant.'
   - Eventually acquired a pejorative sense, referring to a 'lewd female' or 'woman of low social class.'

3. **Silly**
   - In Middle English, "silly" meant 'happy, blessed, innocent.'
   - Its modern meaning has shifted to 'foolish, inane, absurd.'
   - The connotations of "silly" have reversed from strongly positive to strongly negative over centuries.

Semantic degradation reflects shifts in social attitudes and values, causing words that were once neutral or positive to acquire negative associations over time.

## 13.6.6 Interactions of Semantic Changes
Semantic changes in one word of a language often interact with or result in semantic changes in another word. Here are some examples:

1. **Hund and Docga:**
   - In Old English, "hund" referred to dogs in general.
   - Over time, its meaning became more specific, referring to certain breeds of dogs.
   - Conversely, "docga" in Old English referred to a particular breed of dog.
   - Its meaning has since become more general, referring to dogs in general.
   - This illustrates how the semantic system as a whole can remain balanced despite changes to individual words.

2. **Mete, Flæsc, and Foda:**
   - In Old English, "mete" (modern-day "meat") referred to food in general.
   - "Flæsc" (now "flesh") referred to any type of animal tissue.
   - Over time, the meaning of "meat" became restricted to the flesh of animals, while "flesh" largely refers to human tissue.
   - Additionally, "foda," the Old English word for 'animal fodder,' became modern-day "food," with its meaning generalized to include all forms of nourishment.
   - Thus, the change in referent for "meat" created a semantic gap, which was filled by the broadening of the meaning of "food."

These examples demonstrate how semantic changes in one word can influence the meanings of other words, leading to a complex interplay within the semantic system of a language.
