# 3.3 Phonological Rules
## 3.3.1 Phonological Rules
**Phonological Rules:**
- Phonemes and allophones belong to different levels of language structure.
- Phonemes are abstract mental entities, while allophones are physical events.
- Phonological rules describe the mapping between phonemic and phonetic elements.
- Speaker's knowledge of phonological rules enables the translation of phonemes into speech sounds.

**Example:**
- Consider English words like "seat" /sit/ and "loot" /lut/.
- The final /t/ in phonemic form is pronounced differently in careful speech, represented by [t] or [ɾ].

**Descriptive Rule:**
- The example illustrates a rule for the pronunciation of /t/ in different contexts.
- The rule: /t/ is pronounced as [ɾ] after a stressed vowel and before an unstressed vowel.

**Rule Components:**    
- A phonological rule consists of three parts:
	- Sound(s) affected by the rule (X),
	- Environment where the rule applies (C_D),
	- Result of the rule (Y).

**Shorthand Representation:**
- Rules can be written in the form X→Y / C_D, where C_D represents the conditioning environment.
- Example: /t/→[ɾ]/stressed vowel__unstressed vowel, meaning /t/ is pronounced as [ɾ] between a stressed and an unstressed vowel.

**Application of Rule:**
- The rule in (4) is applied to illustrate the pronunciation of /t/ in different contexts.
- Example: /t/→[ɾ]/stressed vowel__unstressed vowel, /t/→[t]/everywhere else.

**Derivation Process:**
- The phonetic forms of words are derived from their phonemic forms using phonological rules.
- In listening, the reverse process occurs: perception of phonetic form, application of phonological rules, and obtaining a matching phonemic form.

**Example Illustration:**
- The phonemic forms of "seat" and "loot" undergo rule application, resulting in the phonetic forms [siɾ@d] and [luɾ@d], respectively.
- The process of speaking involves applying rules, while listening involves reversing this process to understand utterances.
## 3.3.2 Natural Classes
**Flapping of /t/ and /d/:**
- Both /t/ and /d/ can be pronounced as a flap.
- Example: "seed" [sid], "seeded" [siɾ@d], "seat" [sit], "seated" [siɾ@d].

**Modified Rule:**
- Rule (7) is modified to include both /t/ and /d/: /t, d/→[ɾ] / stressed vowel __ unstressed vowel.

**Articulatory Descriptions:**
- /t/: Voiceless alveolar (oral) stop.
- /d/: Voiced alveolar (oral) stop.

**Natural Classes:**
- Both /t/ and /d/ are alveolar (oral) stops, the only oral alveolar stops in English.
- Natural class: /t, d/ - a group of sounds sharing articulatory properties, excluding other sounds.

**Generalization:**
- Natural classes include sounds that share specific articulatory or auditory properties.
- Example: [i, u, eI, oU] form the natural class of tense vowels in English.

**Sibilants and Labials:**
- Sibilants: [s, ʃ, t͡ʃ, z, ʒ, d͡ʒ] share a high-pitched, hissing sound quality.
- Labials: [f, v, p, b, m, w, w8] are produced at the lips.

**Obstruents and Sonorants:**
- Obstruents obstruct airflow; includes **stops, fricatives, and affricates**.
- Sonorants have a relatively open airflow; includes nasals, liquids, glides, and vowels.
- Labial obstruents: [p, f, b, v]; Labial sonorants: [m, w, w8].
- Labial consonants (union): [p, f, b, v, m, w, w8].

**Usefulness in Phonological Rules:**
- Dividing consonants into obstruents and sonorants aids in stating some phonological rules
## 3.3.3 Types of Phonological Rules
**Types of Phonological Rules:**
1. **Assimilation:**
	- Causes a sound to become more like a neighboring sound with respect to some phonetic property.
	- Example: Nasal Place Assimilation in English.
2. **Dissimilation:**
	- Causes two close or adjacent sounds to become less similar with respect to some property.
	- Example: Manner dissimilation in Modern Greek.
4. **Insertion (epenthesis):**
	- Causes a segment not present at the phonemic level to be added to the phonetic form.
	- Example: Voiceless stop insertion in English.
5. **Deletion:**
	- Eliminates a sound from the phonetic form that was present at the phonemic level.
	- Example: /h/-Deletion in unstressed syllables in English.
	- Example: Dissimilatory deletion affecting [ɹ] in English.
5. **Metathesis:**
	- Changes the order of sounds.
	- Example: CV metathesis in Leti.
6. **Strengthening (Fortition):**
	- Makes sounds stronger.
		- aspiration pat [p}{t]
1. **Weakening (Lenition):**
	- Causes sounds to become weaker.
	- Example: Flapping in American English.
	- Example: Reduction of unstressed vowels in English.
**Examples:**
- Nasal Place Assimilation in English changes the place of articulation of /n/ based on the following consonant.
- Manner dissimilation in Modern Greek changes a stop to a fricative when followed by another stop.
- Voiceless stop insertion in English occurs between a nasal and a voiceless fricative.
- /h/-Deletion in English eliminates /h/ in unstressed syllables.
- CV metathesis in Leti swaps the positions of consonants and vowels in certain contexts.
- Aspiration in English makes voiceless stops aspirated at the beginning of stressed syllables.
- Flapping in American English realizes an alveolar stop as [ɾ] after a stressed vowel and before an unstressed vowel.
- Reduction of unstressed vowels in English results in [@] or a syllabic consonant.

## 3.3.4 Multiple Rule Application
**Multiple Rule Application:**
- Phonological rules are often independent of each other.
- Multiple rules can apply simultaneously without affecting each other when their environments do not overlap.
- Example: Flapping and vowel reduction in the pronunciation of "photograph."
**Complex Interactions:**
- Some cases involve more complex interactions among phonological rules.
- Example: Interaction of flapping with the diphthong-raising rule in some English dialects.
**Example Illustration (Diphthong-Raising and Flapping):**
	**Phonological Rules:**
		1. **Diphthong-raising:** /AI/ is pronounced as [I] before a voiceless sound.
		2. **Flapping:** /t/ is pronounced as [ɾ] after a stressed vowel and before an unstressed vowel.
	**Example Word: "writer"**
		1. **Phonemic form:** /'ɹAIt@ɹ/
		2. **Possible Rule Application Orders:**
			- a. Flapping → Diphthong-raising: /'ɹAIɾ@ɹ/ → [ɹAIɾɹ] (Incorrect for "writer").
			- b. Diphthong-raising → Flapping: /'ɹIt@ɹ/ → [ɹIɾɹ] (Correct for "writer").
**Conclusion:**
- For speakers with diphthong-raising, the correct order is Diphthong-raising → Flapping.
- Flapping first would disrupt the environment for diphthong-raising, resulting in an incorrect pronunciation.
**Note:**
- The example demonstrates the importance of considering the order of rule application in cases where rules may interact or have overlapping environments.

## 3.3.5 Obligatory and Optional Rules
**Obligatory Rules:**
- Always apply in the speech of all speakers of a language or dialect.
- Examples in English include aspiration, vowel nasalization, and vowel lengthening.
- Effects are subtle and may be difficult to notice, but they contribute to a native accent.
- Non-application of obligatory rules can make someone sound like a non-native speaker.
**Foreign Accents:**
- Foreign accents often result from the difficulty of "turning off" the obligatory rules of one's native language.
- People tend to apply their native language's rules even when learning a new language, contributing to foreign accents.
**Unaware Application:**
- People are often unaware of obligatory rules, and this lack of awareness can lead to the unintentional application of these rules even in inappropriate contexts.
**Optional Rules:**
- May or may not apply in any given utterance.
- Responsible for variations in speech.
- Example: The /h/-deletion rule in English, where "He handed her his hat" can be pronounced as [hi hænd@d hɹ hIz hæt] or [hi hænd@d ɹIz hæt] based on whether the optional rule is applied or not.
**Dependence on Rate and Style:**
- Usage of optional rules depends on factors such as the rate and style of speech.
- Different pronunciations may arise based on whether optional rules are applied or omitted in a particular context.
