# 2.1 Representing Speech Sounds
## 2.1.1 Studying Pronunciation

> [!ABSTRACT]
> This section highlights the significance of pronunciation in language, historical examples showcasing its importance, and the advanced methods and technologies employed in phonetic studies.

**Pronunciation as a Dialect Identifier:**
- Pronunciation can reveal regional or dialectal differences in spoken language.
- Examples include variations in pronouncing words like "pin" and "pen" or the word "push" in certain parts of Ohio. 

**Historical Example: Shibboleth in the Bible:**
- The Bible (Judges 12:4–6) recounts a story where a group used the password "shibboleth" to identify enemies who couldn't pronounce the \<sh>\ sound.
- The inability to pronounce led to the identification and subsequent killing of the attackers.

## 2.1.2 The "Right" Phonetic Alphabet

> [!ABSTRACT]
> The section discusses the complexities of phonetic transcription, emphasizing the absence of a definitive "right" way to transcribe pronunciation. It highlights the importance of agreement between readers and authors on the assigned sound qualities in a phonetic alphabet. Criteria for a useful phonetic alphabet are outlined, emphasizing the representation of individual sounds, differentiation between sounds, and accounting for contextual variations. Criticisms of the English spelling system are presented, pointing out inconsistencies and limitations. The International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) is introduced as a consistent and universal alternative, offering a one-to-one correspondence between sounds and symbols, applicable to all languages, and accommodating different levels of transcription detail. The section emphasizes that while some symbols may resemble English orthography, the IPA is a distinct and superior system for phonetic representation.

**No Definite "Right" Phonetic Transcription:**
- No single correct way to transcribe pronunciation.
- Choices influenced by arbitrary, typographical, or historical considerations.

**Agreement on Sound Qualities in Phonetic Alphabet:**
- Crucial for both readers and authors to agree on the sound qualities assigned to symbols in a phonetic alphabet.
- Dictionaries provide guides to pronunciation symbols.

**Characteristics of a Useful Phonetic Alphabet:**
- Each symbol should represent only one sound.
- Different sounds should have different symbols.
- Similar sounds with contextual differences should be represented.

**Issues with English Spelling System:**
- English spelling system is not a good phonetic alphabet.
- Same sound spelled differently, and same letters represent different sounds.
- Combinations of letters or single letters may represent single sounds or combinations.
- Some letters may not represent any sound at all.

**The International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA):**
- IPA is a consistent and unambiguous transcription system.
- Features a one-to-one correspondence between sounds and symbols.
- Applicable to all spoken human languages, not limited to English.
- Allows transcriptions with different levels of detail, from broad to fine phonetic detail.
- Distinct from English orthography despite some similar symbols.
## 2.1.3 Types of Speech Sounds

> [!ABSTRACT]
> This section delves into the foundational aspects of speech sounds, categorizing them into segments and suprasegmentals. Segments encompass consonants and vowels, with the former impeding airflow through vocal tract constriction, while the latter allows free airflow. Suprasegmentals, such as stress, tone, and intonation, apply to entire strings of consonants and vowels. The articulatory distinctions and acoustic differences between consonants and vowels are explored. The role of each in syllables, with onsets, rhymes, nuclei, and codas, is explained, emphasizing the nucleus as the heart of the syllable carrying suprasegmental information. Vowels are recognized as better suited for conveying suprasegmental features. The section also introduces vowel categories: monophthongs (simple vowels) and diphthongs (complex vowels), illustrating the distinction with examples. Upcoming discussions will further explore monophthongs and diphthongs in detail.

**Speech Sound Categories:**
- Phonetics divides speech sounds into two main categories: ***segments*** and ***suprasegmentals***.
- Segments include consonants and vowels, while suprasegmentals encompass properties like stress, tone, and intonation.

**Consonants and Vowels - Articulatory Distinctions:**
- Both consonants and vowels involve configuring the vocal tract.
- Consonants have a constriction in the vocal tract impeding airflow.
- Vowels have, at most, a slight narrowing, allowing free airflow through the oral cavity.
- Acoustic differences also distinguish consonants and vowels.

**Roles in Syllables:**
- Every utterance contains at least one syllable.
- A syllable may consist of a single sound or multiple sounds.
- Syllable breakdown includes onset (preceding the rhyme) and rhyme (vowel and consonants after it).
- Rhyme further breaks down into nucleus (vowel-like part) and coda (final consonants).

**Suprasegmental Information in Syllables:**
- Nucleus, the heart of the syllable, carries suprasegmental information like stress, volume, and pitch.
- Vowels are better suited to carry this information than consonants.

**Vowel Categories:**
- Vowels categorized as ***monophthongs*** (simple vowels) and ***diphthongs*** (complex vowels).
	- see [[Monophthongs vs Diphthongs]]
- Monophthongs have a single configuration of the vocal tract.
- Diphthongs consist of a sequence of two different configurations but act as a single syllable nucleus.
- Distinction illustrated with examples like "knives" (diphthong) and "naive" (two separate monophthongs).

## 2.1.4 Phonetic Symbols for English

> [!ABSTRACT]
> This section introduces the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) symbols for English segments, emphasizing their distinction from conventional English letters. Enclosed in square brackets, these symbols represent the sounds of language, exemplified in the sound inventory of Standard American English. Example words are provided to illustrate Standard American English pronunciations. The discussion emphasizes that while linguistic analysis may break down speech into words and sounds, everyday speech occurs in phrases and sentences, known as running speech. This continuous speech may be influenced by surrounding words, posing research questions about how the human mind processes running speech into meaningful components. The section sets the foundation for understanding and using IPA symbols in the context of English phonetics.

**IPA Symbols for English Segments:**
- The section presents International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) symbols for English segments.
- Phonetic symbols are enclosed in square brackets [ ] to distinguish them from regular letters or words.

**Representation of Sounds, Not Letters:**
- Phonetic symbols represent the sounds of language, not the letters of English.
- They are distinct from conventional English letters.

**Example Words and Standard American English:**
- The table provides IPA symbols for the sound inventory of Standard American English.
- Examples demonstrate the use of Standard American English pronunciations.

**Speech in Phrases and Sentences:**
- Everyday speech occurs in phrases and sentences, known as running speech or continuous speech.
- Linguists may analyze speech into words and sounds, but in practical terms, everyday speech is not separated into these components.

**Impact of Surrounding Words:**
- Pronunciations in running speech may be influenced by surrounding words.
- The phenomenon of phonetic co-articulation and phonological assimilation is mentioned.

**Research Questions in Language Processing:**
- Open research questions involve understanding how the human mind processes running speech into meaningful components.

# 2.2 Articulation: English Consonants
## 2.2.1 Introducing Articulatory Phonetics

> [!ABSTRACT]
> This section introduces articulatory phonetics, emphasizing the study of speech sounds through observations of articulatory gestures. An illustrative experiment involving the word "hiss" prompts consideration of the cooled parts of the tongue and roof of the mouth during specific articulatory actions. The focus is on the articulation of English consonants, requiring attention to three key aspects: voicing (vibration of vocal folds), place of articulation (location of airstream constriction), and manner of articulation (how the airstream is constricted). These elements, collectively known as segmental features, play a crucial role in describing consonant sounds. The discussion clarifies terminology, highlighting that statements about sounds (e.g., "[p] is voiceless") refer to the phonetic transcription symbol rather than written letters.

**Articulatory Phonetics:**
- Articulatory phonetics involves studying speech sounds through observations of articulatory gestures, the motion or positioning of vocal tract parts during sound production.

**Observational Experiment:**
- *Experiment*: Say the word "hiss" and hold the [s]. Inhale while maintaining the [s] tongue position.
- *Observation*: Note which part of the tongue and the roof of the mouth is cooled by the incoming airstream during this articulatory process.

**Articulation of Consonants:**
- *Articulation* refers to the motion or positioning of vocal tract parts, particularly muscular parts like the tongue and/or lips, during the production of speech sounds.

**Focus on English Consonants:**
- This file emphasizes the articulation of English consonants.
- *Consonants* are speech sounds produced with a constriction in the vocal tract that impedes airflow.

**Three Aspects of Consonant Articulation:**
- *Voicing*: Involves whether the vocal folds vibrate during the constriction (voiced or voiceless).
- *Place of Articulation*: Concerns where the airstream is constricted.
- *Manner of Articulation*: Involves how the airstream is constricted.

**Segmental Features:**
- Voicing, place, and manner of articulation are *segmental features*.
- These features provide crucial information when describing a consonant.

**Clarification on Terminology:**
- When stating things like "[p] is voiceless" or "the [p] in pan," it refers to the sound represented by the symbol [p], not the letter \<p>\.

**Phonetic Transcription Reminder:**
- Emphasis on discussing speech sounds symbolized by phonetic transcription, not the written letters (e.g., \<p>\, \<j>\).

## 2.2.2 Anatomy of Human Speech Production

> [!ABSTRACT]
> To understand the production of speech sounds, knowledge of the human anatomy involved is crucial. Three main components contribute to speech production: the larynx with vocal folds, the vocal tract comprising oral and nasal cavities, and the subglottal system in the respiratory system. During speech, air flows through these components, with inhalation channeling air into the lungs and exhalation forcing air out through the larynx and vocal tract. The exhaled airstream serves as the energy source for sound production, involving vocal fold vibration or the creation of noises through narrow mouth openings. English speech sounds primarily utilize a pulmonic egressive airstream mechanism, where air is exhaled to produce speech.

**Anatomy of Speech Production:**
- Understanding speech production involves knowledge of three basic components of human anatomy.

**Components:**
- *Larynx*: Located in the throat, it contains the vocal folds and the *glottis*.
- *Vocal Tract*: Comprises oral and nasal cavities above the larynx.
- *Subglottal System*: Part of the respiratory system situated below the larynx.

**Airflow During Speech Production:**
- Air is channeled through the nasal or oral cavity, or both, through the larynx, and into the lungs during inhalation.
- During exhalation, air is forced out of the lungs through the larynx and the vocal tract.

**Energy Source for Sound Production:**
- The exhaled airstream passing through the oral or nasal cavity provides energy for sound production.
- Sound production can involve vibrating vocal folds or the creation of hissing or popping noises as air escapes through narrow openings in the mouth.

**Airstream Mechanism:**
- Pulmonic (lung) egressive (blowing out) airstream mechanism is used for sound production in English.
- This mechanism involves exhaling air to create speech sounds.

## 2.2.3 States of the Glottis: Voicing

> [!ABSTRACT]
> The larynx, located atop the trachea, houses vocal folds—muscle folds, not cords. The glottis, the space between the folds, can vary in configuration: wide open (triangle), nearly closed, or partially open during whispering. The epiglottis protects the folds during swallowing. Voicing occurs when vocal folds vibrate, creating a buzzing sensation. Sounds are categorized as voiced (with vibration) or voiceless (without). Identification of voicing involves simple tactile methods, such as feeling for vibration, or advanced techniques like analyzing spectrograms or using high-speed video examination.

**Location of the Larynx:**
- The larynx is positioned at the top of the trachea (windpipe).

**Vocal Folds and Glottis:**
- Vocal folds, not actual cords, are horizontal muscle folds within the larynx.
- The glottis is the space between the vocal folds.
- Frontal attachment of vocal folds is fixed, while the rear can open and close, altering glottis size.

**Glottal Configurations:**
- Glottis can be wide open (triangle shape), nearly closed, or partially open (whispering).
- The epiglottis, a cartilage flap, can cover and protect the vocal folds during swallowing.

**Voicing and Vocal Fold Vibration:**
- When vocal folds are open, air flows freely; when they vibrate, it's called voicing.
- Voiced sounds involve vocal fold vibration; voiceless sounds occur without vocal fold vibration.

**Identification of Voicing:**
- *Simple technique*: Feel for vocal fold vibration by placing a hand on the throat.
- Spectrograms (acoustic signal pictures) and high-speed video examination are alternative methods.

## 2.2.4 Place of Articulation

> [!ABSTRACT]
> Consonants are characterized by their place of articulation, indicating where the vocal tract constriction occurs. Illustrated with a sagittal section of the vocal tract, various places are described:
> 
> - *Bilabial*: Both lips close together.
> - *Labiodental*: Lower lip against upper front teeth.
> - *Interdentals*: Tongue tip between front teeth.
> - *Alveolar*: Tongue tip at/near the upper alveolar ridge.
> - *Post-Alveolar*: Produced behind the alveolar ridge, at the front of the hard palate.
> - *Palatal*: Tongue raised near the center of the hard palate.
> - *Velar*: Produced with the back part of the tongue near the soft palate.
> - *Glottal*: Air constricted at the glottis. Examples for each category are provided.

**Place of Articulation:**
- Describes where the vocal tract constriction occurs, impeding airflow.
- Illustrated with a sagittal section of the vocal tract.

**Bilabial Consonants:**
- Both lips brought together.
- Examples: [p] pat, [b] bat, [m] mat, [w] with, [w8] where.

**Labiodental Consonants:**
- Lower lip against upper front teeth.
- Examples: [f] fat, [v] vat.

**Interdentals:**
- Tongue tip between front teeth.
- Examples: [T] thigh, [ð] thy.

**Alveolar Sounds:**
- Tongue tip at/near the upper alveolar ridge.
- Examples: [t] tab, [d] dab, [s] sip, [z] zip, [n] noose, [ɾ] atom, [l] loose, [ɹ] red.

**Post-Alveolar Sounds:**
- Produced just behind the alveolar ridge, at the front of the hard palate.
- Examples: [S] leash, [Z] measure, [] church, [] judge.

**Palatal Sounds:**
- Tongue raised near the center of the hard palate.
- Example: [j] yes.

**Velar Consonants:**
- Produced with the back part of the tongue near the velum (soft palate).
- Examples: [k] kill, [g] gill, [ŋ] sing.

**Glottal Sounds:**
- Air constricted at the glottis.
- Examples: [h] high, history, [?]

## 2.2.5 Manner of Articulation

> [!ABSTRACT]
> The manner of articulation classifies consonants based on how the airstream is constricted or modified in the vocal tract. Various categories include stops (complete obstruction), fricatives (turbulent noise), affricates (combination of stop and fricative), nasals (air escapes through the nose), approximants (constrictions without turbulence), liquids (slightly more constriction), glides (slight closure), and flaps (quick closure). Examples and descriptions of each category are provided, showcasing the diversity of English consonant sounds.

**Manner of Articulation:**
- Describes how the airstream is constricted or modified in the vocal tract.
- Depends on the degree and type of closure of articulators.

**Stops (Plosives):**
- Obstruct the airstream completely.
- Examples: [p] pat, [b] bat, [t] tab, [d] dab, [k] kill, [g] gill, [?] glottal stop.

**Fricatives:**
- Form a nearly complete obstruction, creating turbulent noise (frication).
- Examples: [f] fat, [v] vat, [T] thigh, [ð] thy, [s] sip, [z] zip, [S] leash, [Z] measure, [h] high.

**Affricates:**
- Begin with a stop and end with a fricative.
- Examples: [] church, [] judge.

**Nasals:**
- Produced by lowering the velum, allowing air to escape through the nose.
- Examples: [m] mat, [n] noose, [ŋ] sing.

**Approximants:**
- Constrictions not narrow enough to block vocal tract or cause turbulence.
- Further divided into liquids and glides.

**Liquids:**
- Slightly more constriction than glides.
- Examples: [l] leaf, [ɹ] red.

**Syllabic Consonants:**
- Nasals and liquids sometimes act as vowels within a syllable.
- Represented with a short vertical line below the phonetic symbol.

**Glides:**
- Slight closure, close to vowel sounds.
- Examples: [w] woo, [w8] (voiceless variant), [j] yawn.

**Flap (Tap):**
- Complete oral cavity obstruction with a quick closure.
- Example: [ɾ] in writer, ladder.

## 2.2.6 Investigating Place and Manner of Articulation: Palatography

> [!ABSTRACT]
> Palatography, a method for investigating the place and manner of articulation, involves examining where the tongue makes contact with the roof of the mouth during speech. Static palatography uses a painted tongue to record contact patterns for isolated sounds, while dynamic palatography employs an artificial hard palate with electrodes to study tongue movements during an utterance. Comparisons between static and dynamic palatography reveal nuances in pronunciation, such as dental articulation and variations in tongue position. However, palatography is limited to describing tongue position and does not provide information about voicing or nasality in speech sounds.

**Palatography:**
- Method for investigating the place and manner of articulation.
- Examines where the tongue touches the roof of the mouth during articulation.

**Static Palatography:**
- Involves painting the tongue black with a mixture of olive oil and charcoal powder.
- Speaker produces a sound, and the tongue leaves a black trace indicating contact points.
- Suitable for isolated sounds, messy, and immediate recording of contact pattern.

**Dynamic Palatography:**
- Utilizes an artificial hard palate with small electrodes embedded.
- More sophisticated than static palatography.
- Records tongue movements against electrodes during an utterance directly into a computer.
- Allows the study of sequences of contacts during the production of an utterance.
- Provides exact data on where, how much, and how long contact occurs between the tongue and the hard palate.
- Covers only the hard palate, making it challenging to observe contact in the soft palate region.

**Comparison of Static vs. Dynamic Palatography:**
- Static palatography shows the contact pattern during the production of a nonsense word.
- Dynamic palatography indicates locations of sensors on the artificial hard palate during the [d] of a phrase.
- Both images show full contact with the alveolar ridge and part of the hard palate, consistent with [d] being an alveolar stop.
- Minor pronunciation variations revealed: static shows tongue partly touching teeth (dental), while dynamic shows the tongue slightly farther back, not against the front teeth.

**Limitations of Palatography:**
- Provides information only about the position of the tongue within the mouth.
- Does not convey details about voicing or nasality of the sounds produced.

## 2.2.7 The Consonant Chart

> [!ABSTRACT]
> The consonant chart serves as a valuable reference tool for understanding English consonant sounds through a three-part articulatory description: Voicing-Place-Manner. By locating phonetic symbols on the chart, one can easily determine the voicing (shaded for voiced, nonshaded for voiceless), place of articulation (vertical column), and manner of articulation (horizontal row) for a specific sound. The chart facilitates the identification of sound descriptions and symbols in both directions, aiding in the recognition of voiced interdental fricatives or voiceless post-alveolar fricatives, for instance. Additionally, the chart enables the discovery of sound classes, such as alveolars or stops, by reading off relevant columns or rows. Familiarity with the chart, along with the provided list of phonetic symbols, enhances the recognition of speech sounds, emphasizing that the focus is on phonetic symbols representing speech sounds, not the letters in the English spelling system.

**Consonant Chart:**
- Three-part articulatory description: Voicing-Place-Manner.
- Example: Voiced palatal glide or voiceless bilabial stop.
- Chart structure: Voicing (shaded column), Place (vertical column), Manner (horizontal row).
- Use of phonetic symbols for easy reference.

**Finding Sound Descriptions:**
- Locate phonetic symbol on the chart.
- Check shading for voicing information.
- Determine place of articulation from the vertical column.
- Identify manner of articulation from the horizontal row.
- Example: [D] is the voiced interdental fricative.

**Finding Symbols from Descriptions:**
- Reverse the procedure to find a symbol.
- Example: Voiced post-alveolar fricative corresponds to [Z].

**Finding Sound Classes:**
- Identify groups of sounds with shared characteristics.
- Example: To find alveolars, read off sounds in the "alveolar" column.
- Example: To find stops, read off sounds in the "stop" row.

**Familiarization with the Chart:**
- Important for recognizing phonetic symbols.
- Helps in associating symbols with consonant sounds.
