# 3.4 Implicational Laws
## 3.4.1 Recurring Phonological Patterns
**Introduction to Phonetic Diversity:**
- Human languages exhibit a wide range of sounds in phonetics.
- Despite the diversity, certain sounds are more prevalent than others.

**Common Speech Sounds:**
- Stop consonants [p] and [t], along with the vowel [a], are widely used across various languages.
- [p], [t], and [a] are considered more common speech sounds.

**Less Common Speech Sounds:**
- Pharyngeal fricatives ([ħ] and [ʕ]) used in Arabic, voiceless vowels (e.g., in whispered speech), and clicks (e.g., tsk, tsk! and horse-calling sounds in American languages) are less common.
- Pharyngeal fricatives, voiceless vowels, and clicks are found in fewer phonetic inventories.

**Purpose of the Explanation:**
- The objective of the provided information is to elucidate the reasons behind the prevalence of certain sounds over others.

## 3.4.2 Sound Inventories
**General Observation:**
- If a language incorporates a less common sound, it typically includes one of its more common counterparts in its phoneme inventory.
**Definition of "Uses a Sound":**
- "Uses a sound" means the sound is part of the language's inventory of phonemes, making it contrastive with other sounds in the language.
**Clarification on "More Common Counterparts":**
- "More common counterparts" refers to the presence of a similar, more common sound in the inventory, differing only in one or two phonetic features.
- Examples include the counterpart relationship between voiceless vowels and voiced vowels of the same tongue height, tongue advancement, and lip rounding.
**Illustrative Table:**
- A table is presented with some less common sounds and their more common counterparts to exemplify the concept.
- Notably, the terms "more common" and "less common" are used relatively, not as absolute standards.
**Implicational Law:**
- The presence of a less common sound implies the presence of its more common counterpart in the language's inventory.
- The implication is not reversible; the presence of a common sound does not imply the presence of its less common counterpart.
**Application to Natural Classes:**
- Implicational laws extend to natural classes of sounds.
- Example: The class of voiceless consonants is relatively more common than voiced consonants. If a language uses voiced stops, it will also use voiceless stops, but the reverse is not necessarily true.
**Extension to Fricatives and Stops:**
- The presence of fricatives in a language implies the presence of stops with the same places of articulation.
- For instance, if a language uses [s], it also uses [t].
## 3.4.3 Frequency and Distribution
**Observation on Usage:**
- The second observation focuses on the frequency and distribution of sounds in a language.
**Limited Usage of Less Common Sounds:**
- Even if a language incorporates a less common sound, such sounds are typically used in fewer words compared to more common sounds.
- Example: A language using a pharyngeal fricative will have limited usage compared to a more common velar fricative.
**Wider Distribution of More Common Sounds:**
- More common sounds have a broader distribution within a language, meaning they occur in more phonetic environments.
- Example: Cantonese Chinese features stops and fricatives, but fricatives may occur only as the first sound in a syllable, while stops have a wider distribution, occurring both syllable-initially and syllable-finally.
**English Example - Limited Usage and Distribution:**
- Illustration with the English phoneme [ð] as a less common sound.
- \[ð] is relatively rare globally, and wherever [ð] occurs in English, [z] can also occur.
- \[ð] is limited in usage, often found in "grammatical" words like "the," "this," "that," etc., and occurs less frequently at the end of words compared to [z].
**Note on Individual Word Count:**
- While the total number of individual words containing [ð] is small, some are among the most commonly used words in English.
**Classification of Sounds:**
- The sounds are classified into less common and more common categories, highlighting their relative prevalence globally.

## 3.4.4 Acquisition of Sounds
**Introduction to the Observation:**
- The third observation revolves around the order of acquisition of more common and less common sounds, particularly in the context of children learning a language.

**Early Acquisition of More Common Sounds:**
- Children tend to acquire the usage of more common sounds before less common ones during their language development.

**Substitution of Common for Less Common Sounds:**
- In the early stages, children may substitute more common sounds for less common ones as they haven't fully mastered the complete sound inventory of their native language.
- Example: A child saying [dɪs wʌn] for "this one," substituting the more common [d] for the less common [ð].

**Indication of Incomplete Acquisition:**
- The substitution indicates that the child has not yet fully acquired the usage of the relatively less common sound [ð], while [d] is readily available for use.

**Characteristic Order of Acquisition:**
- When tracking language development from babbling through maturity, a consistent order of sound acquisition appears.
- This order is relatively constant for children across different languages.

**Implicational Laws and Generalization:*
- Implicational laws generalize that the acquisition of a relatively less common sound implies that its more common counterpart has already been acquired.
- This observation provides a broader understanding of language development patterns in children worldwide.
## 3.4.5 Sound Change
**Introduction to Sound Change:**
- The fourth observation pertains to language change, specifically the stability of less common sounds compared to more common ones.

**Stability of Common vs. Less Common Sounds:**
- Less common sounds are generally less stable than their more common counterparts during the course of language evolution.

**Historical Example - Old English to Modern English:**
- Example from the history of English: In Old English, the word "knight" had a voiceless velar fricative [x] between the vowel and [t].
- Over time, during the development of English, the velar fricative was lost, and now "knight" rhymes with "quite."

**Loss of Velar Fricatives in English:**
- Instances of the velar fricative sound ([x]) in words like "height," "sight," "fight," "might," etc., were lost in the evolution of English.
- English speakers ceased using velar fricatives altogether, making them challenging when learning languages like German, which still uses them.

**Alignment with Implicational Law:**
- The observation aligns with the implicational law stating that fricatives are less common than stops.
- The less common fricative [x] is less stable and more likely to be lost or changed to a more common sound, like the corresponding stop consonant [k].

**General Trend in Language Change:**
- Less common sounds are more susceptible to change or disappearance during the natural evolution of languages, contributing to the dynamic nature of linguistic systems.

## 3.4.6 Explaining Implicational Laws
**Circular Explanations:**
- Initially, one might be tempted to explain implicational laws by stating that more common sounds are acquired first or are more stable in language change because they are more common. However, this explanation is circular, as the observations themselves form the basis for the distinction between more and less common sounds and the implicational laws.

**Alternative Explanation - Communicative Nature:**
- An alternative, non-circular explanation involves understanding observations and implicational laws in terms of the communicative nature of language.

**Goal of Communication:**
- The primary goal of language users is communication—successfully transmitting messages from speakers to hearers.

**Role of Ease of Production:**
- Sounds that are difficult to produce may lead to inconsistencies in pronunciation, potentially causing confusion for the hearer.
- Limited usage and potential disappearance of difficult sounds may result from speakers avoiding them to prevent misunderstanding, contributing to language change.

**Ease of Production as an Explanation:**
- Instances where a sound X is more common than sound Y can be explained by the ease of production.
- Example: [k] is more common than [x] because stops (like [k]) are easier to produce than fricatives (like [x]).

**Distinctive Qualities for Efficient Communication:**
- From the hearer's perspective, sounds that blend too much into surrounding sounds may lose their distinctive qualities, hindering efficient communication.
- Maximally distinct consonants and vowels are more useful for transmitting messages, contributing to the preference for certain sound combinations in languages.

**Examples of Maximally Distinct Carriers:**
- Voiced consonants imply the use of voiceless ones, making voiceless consonants more common than voiced ones due to their perceptual salience.
- Vowels pronounced with the mouth wide open (e.g., [ɑ]) are less consonant-like and more distinct from surrounding consonants compared to vowels pronounced with a somewhat closed mouth (e.g., [i], [u]).

**Implicational Laws for Listener Efficiency:**
- Some implicational laws exist to enhance perception for listeners, making language more efficient.

**Universal Tendencies:**
- Despite the vast variety of sounds in language, universal tendencies include restricting inventories to more common sounds, limiting the utilization of less common sounds, acquiring more common sounds earlier, and witnessing less common sounds being unstable in language change.

**Communication Efficiency Hypothesis:**
- The explanations for these tendencies stem from the hypothesis that people use language for efficient communication, leading to the preference for easily produced and perceived sounds.

# 3.5 How to Solve Phonology Problems
## 3.5.1 Goals of Phonemic Analysis
**Importance of Phonemes:**
- Phonemes are crucial linguistic units, but identifying them is not always straightforward due to language-specific differences and the psychological nature of phonemes.

**Challenges in Phoneme Identification:**
- The set of phonemes varies across languages, requiring a separate analysis for each language.
- Phonemes are psychological units, not physically present in speech, making identification challenging through direct measurements or native speaker intuitions.

**Objective Procedure for Identification:**
- Linguists have developed an objective procedure based on two main observations about sound patterns in phonetic transcription.

**First Observation - Meaningful Distinctions:**
- Phonemes create distinctions in meaning, and minimal pairs reveal these distinctions.
- Example: The minimal pair "led" and "red" shows that [l] and [ɹ] are allophones of separate phonemes in English.
- Lack of minimal pairs for allophones indicates they belong to the same phoneme.
- Example: [bʌʔn̩] and [bbʌtʰn̩] are both possible pronunciations of "button" since [?] and [tʰ] are allophones of the phoneme /t/.

**Second Observation - Systematic Relationship among Allophones:**
- Allophones of a phoneme are not random but share the same psychological function, making them the "same" sound.
- Allophones are systematically related, often sharing phonetic properties and having complementary distribution.
- Predicting which allophone appears in a word is possible through phonological rules.

**Analyzing Physically Present Sounds:**
- By examining the patterns of physically present sounds, linguists can infer the psychological organization of a language, even though it is not directly observable.

**Conclusion:**
- Linguists employ this method to objectively discover the phonemes of a language through the examination of phonetic transcriptions, navigating challenges posed by language-specific variations and the intangible nature of phonemes.

## 3.5.2 How to Do a Phonemic Analysis
**Introduction:**
- A phonemic analysis focuses on determining if sounds ([ɹ] and [ɹ̥]) are contrastive or allophones in the same phoneme.

**Analysis Procedure:** 
	**Minimal Pairs:**
		- No minimal pairs that differ only by [ɹ] and [ɹ̥]. 
	**Free Variation:**
		- No pairs with the same meaning differing in [ɹ] and [ɹ̥].

**Phonetic Environments:**
- Define the phonetic environment as sounds immediately preceding and following within a word.

**Distribution Analysis:** 
	**Voiceless Consonants:**
		- [ɹ̥] appears after voiceless consonants. b. 
	**No Single Natural Class for [ɹ]:**
		- [ɹ] appears after various sounds; no single natural class observed.

**Complementary Distribution:**
- \[ɹ] and [ɹ̥] have complementary gaps in environments.
- \[ɹ] doesn't appear after voiceless consonants; [ɹ̥] doesn't appear after voiced consonants, vowels, or at word boundaries.

**Generalization Rules:**
- **Rule for [ɹ̥]:**
	- [ɹ̥] appears following voiceless consonants.
- **Rule for [ɹ]:**
	- \[ɹ] appears elsewhere.

**Identifying Phoneme and Allophones:**
- **Basic Allophone:** [ɹ] (more versatile).
- **Restricted Allophone:** [ɹ̥] (limited to specific environments).
- Phoneme named after the basic allophone ([ɹ]).

**Phonological Rule:**
- **Rule Notation:** /ɹ/ → [ɹ̥] / after voiceless consonants; /ɹ/ → [ɹ] / elsewhere.
- **Assimilation Process:** Voiced phoneme /ɹ/ becomes voiceless [ɹ̥] after a voiceless consonant.

**Conclusion:**
- Phonemic analysis indicates that [ɹ] and [ɹ̥] are allophones of the same phoneme in English, with [ɹ] as the basic allophone undergoing assimilation to [ɹ̥] after voiceless consonants.
## 3.5.3 Some Potential Trouble Spots
**Introduction:**
- Beginners often face confusion in identifying allophones and determining complementary distribution.

**Automatically Concluding Allophones:**
  - Absence of minimal pairs doesn't automatically conclude sounds as allophones.
   - Complementary distribution must be demonstrated to establish allophony.

**Illustrative Example: [g] and \[ʃ]:**
   - Example: [g] and [ʃ] in English.
   - appears between vowels or at the word's beginning; [ʃ] appears at the word's beginning or end.
   - Overlapping distribution; both can occur at the word's beginning.
   - Conclusion: No phonological rule governs their distribution, implying contrastive distribution and separate phonemes.

**Alternative Method for Demonstrating Contrast:**
   - In the absence of clear complementary distribution, demonstrate no generalization about sound occurrence.
   - Lack of predictability suggests contrastive and separate phonemes.
   - Example: [ŋ] and [h] in English.

**Near-Minimal Pairs:**
   - Near-minimal pairs offer a tool to demonstrate contrast.
    - Example: heard [hɹ̩d] and Bert [bɹ̩t].
    - Emphasizes the importance of immediate adjacent environments.

**Minimal Pairs Definition Clarification:**
   - Minimal pairs aren't restricted to rhyming; they involve words differing in meaning with only one sound difference.

**Identifying Conditioning Environments:** 
	**Hypotheses Formation:**
		- Speculate based on generalizations (e.g., common sounds are basic allophones).
		- Use tendencies cautiously, considering potential exceptions. 
    **Understanding Phonological Processes:**
	    - Allophonic variation stems from phonological rules.
	    - Examine allophones to infer potential phonological processes (e.g., voicing assimilation).
	    - Familiarity with processes simplifies the task.

**Conclusion:**
- Identifying allophones and their complementary distribution requires careful analysis of sound environments and consideration of phonological processes. Understanding general tendencies aids in forming hypotheses, but the focus should be on the specific characteristics of the language under examination.
