# 13.1 Introducing Language Change
## 13.1.1 Synchronic vs. Diachronic Linguistics

#### Synchronic Analysis
- Linguistics recognizes language change as a natural phenomenon.
- Languages change continuously except for those without native speakers (e.g., Latin, Sanskrit).
- Synchronic analysis focuses on the current state of a language, examining phonological processes, morphemes, and syntactic rules at a specific point in time.

#### Diachronic Analysis
- Linguists also study language development over time (diachronic analysis).
- Language change can be observed through historical linguistics.
- External social factors like region, age, gender, ethnicity, and social class contribute to language variation and change.
- Historical linguistics investigates types of language changes, their causes, and why certain changes do not occur.
- It originated in the late 18th century when scholars noticed shared linguistic characteristics among ancient European and Asian languages.
- This led to the concept of language families, exemplified by Proto-Indo-European (PIE) as the common ancestor of languages like Latin, Greek, Gothic, Old Persian, and Sanskrit.
- Many other language families have since been discovered.

## 13.1.2 How Does Language Change?

**Comparison of Lord's Prayer through Different Periods:**
    **Old English (ca. 1100):**
        Features archaic spelling and Old English symbols like <\p> for [T] and <\D> for [D].
    **Middle English (ca. 1400):**
        Shows transition with some archaic elements but with recognizable English.
        Spelling and grammar are evolving.
    **Early Modern English (1611):**
        Closer to contemporary English but retains some archaic syntax and vocabulary.
    **Contemporary English (1994):**
        Reflects modern English with standardized spelling and grammar.
**Language Change in Grammar:**
    **Phonology:**
        Pronunciation shifts over time, evidenced by spelling changes (e.g., <\p> for [T]).
    **Morphology:**
        Evolution of word forms and inflections.
        Changes in word order and sentence structure.
    **Syntax:**
        Alterations in sentence structure and word order.
        Shifts in grammatical rules and usage.
    **Semantics:**
        Changes in word meanings and connotations.
**Conclusion:**
    Languages change across all aspects of grammar, including phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics.
    Future files will detail various types of language change.

## 13.1.3 Why Does a Language Change?
- **Loss of Homogeneity:**
	- No two individuals speak exactly alike, leading to inherent variation between speakers.
	- Geographical divisions exacerbate this variation, as groups of speakers lose communication with each other.
	- Each group undergoes its own linguistic changes, leading to divergence from other groups.

- **Language Contact:**
	- Interaction between languages leads to similarities and borrowing of words and structures.
	- Example: American English borrowing Spanish words from Spanish-speaking communities in California and the Southwest, as well as from Mexican and Cuban immigrants.

- **Explanation Limitations:**
	- Language contact and other factors provide partial explanations for language change.
	- Some language changes occur without a clear motivating cause.
  
- **Conclusion:**
	- Language change occurs due to loss of homogeneity caused by geographical division, as well as language contact.
	- While these factors offer explanations, they do not always fully explain language change, which can sometimes occur spontaneously.

## 13.1.4 Is Language Change Bad?
- **Resistance to Change:**
	- Some individuals perceive language change negatively and resist it.
	- Jonathan Swift supported grammarians' efforts to regulate language usage and change based on prescriptive rules derived from classical Latin.

- **Prescriptive Grammar:**
	- Grammarians based rules on classical Latin, considering it a perfect, unchanging model language.
	- Despite the decline of Latin as a model, some people still resist linguistic change consciously.

- **Example: The Word "Comprise":**
	- Traditionally, "comprise" meant the whole "comprises" its parts.
	- Modern usage shifts to "comprised of," where the parts "comprise" the whole.
	- Prescriptive grammarians often deem this modern usage as ungrammatical due to its departure from tradition.

- **Linguistic Perspective:**
	- Linguists neither categorize language change as inherently good nor bad; it is merely a natural aspect of language evolution.
	- Descriptively, language change is recognized as a fact of language development.

- **Historical Perspective:**
	- Geoffrey Chaucer's writings from the fourteenth century acknowledge the inevitability of language change.
	- Forms of speech and words evolve over time, with older usages becoming unfamiliar and new usages emerging.
	- Despite these changes, language remains functional for communication and expression.

# 13.2 Language Relatedness
## 13.2.1 Similarities across Languages

- **Basic Similarities:**
	- Languages share similarities due to human anatomical similarities.
	- Many languages utilize similar sounds in their phonological inventories because of the common apparatus used for sound production.

- **Coincidental Similarities:**
	- Occasionally, languages independently develop similar ways of expressing the same meaning.
	- Example: Modern Greek and Malay have similar words for "eye" ([mati] and [mata], respectively), despite no historical or contact-related connection.

- **Iconic Connections:**
	- Some words exhibit an iconic connection between their form and meaning.
	- Example: Onomatopoeic words for sounds like "clock ticking" ([tIktAk], [tIktIk], and [ti?ta?] in English, Arabic, and Mandarin, respectively) mimic the actual sound produced.

- **Language Contact:**
	- Languages in contact may borrow words from each other, leading to shared vocabulary.
	- Example: Spanish borrowing from Arabic, and Taiwan Sign Language borrowing signs from British Sign Language, despite no genetic relation between the languages.

- **Genetic Relatedness:**
	- Two languages may share similarities because they were once the same language but split over time.
	- Known as the relatedness hypothesis, it implies a common origin for the languages.
	- Determining genetic relatedness involves analyzing correlations between form and meaning across vocabularies.
	- Borrowings tend to avoid core vocabulary and grammatical function words, aiding in distinguishing between related languages and those in intensive contact.

- **Systematic Differences:**
	- Differences between similar words (cognates) are systematic and result from language change, indicating genetic relatedness.
	- Discovering language relatedness involves analyzing systematic differences and similarities across language families.

- **Conclusion:**
	- Similarities across languages can arise from anatomical, coincidental, iconic, contact-related, and genetic factors.
	- Determining language relatedness involves examining vocabulary correlations and systematic differences within language families.

## 13.2.2 Models of Language Relatedness
### Models of Language Relatedness

- **Historical Perspective:**
	- The concept of language relatedness dates back to Sir William Jones in the late 18th century, who suggested that Sanskrit, Ancient Greek, and Latin shared a common ancestor, Proto-Indo-European.
	- The relatedness theory was influenced by Darwin's theory of evolution, considering languages as analogous to biological organisms with "family trees" and "ancestors".

- **Family Tree Model:**
	- Formulated by August Schleicher in 1871, this model assumes regular phonological changes among languages.
	- Uses terms like mother, daughter, and sister languages to denote relationships.
	- Provides a visual representation of language evolution, showing the direction of change and relations among languages.

- **Language Families:**
	- Linguistic research has identified numerous language families, with Indo-European being one of the largest.
	- SIL International's Ethnologue identifies 146 language families, along with various sign languages, creoles, pidgins, and unclassified languages.

- **Disadvantages of Family Tree Model:**
	- Misconceptions arise about language change, assuming uniform speech communities and abrupt language splits.
	- Modern linguistic evidence contradicts these assumptions, showing that languages are variable and change gradually over time.

- **Wave Theory:**
	- Proposed by Johannes Schmidt in 1872, this model represents language relationships as waves spreading gradually, similar to ripples on a pond.
	- Recognizes the spread of changes throughout dialects or languages, resulting in varying degrees of similarity.

- **Advantages and Disadvantages:**
	- Both models offer useful frameworks for understanding language change and relatedness.
	- The family tree model simplifies relationships but overlooks linguistic variation and contact effects.
	- The wave model accounts for gradual change but may struggle with analyzing genetic history accurately.

- **Conclusion:**
	- Neither model provides a complete account of language change or relatedness.
	- Linguistic similarities can arise from various factors such as borrowing, independent changes, morphological and syntactic structures, among others.

# 13.3 Sound Change
## 13.3.1 What is Sound Change?

- **Significance of Sound Change:**
	- Sound change is a crucial aspect of language evolution and is extensively studied.
	- It influences not only the phonetics but also the morphology, syntax, and semantics of a language.

- **Definition and Process:**
	- Sound change involves alterations in the phonetics of a sound due to phonological processes.
	- For example, in Old English, the voiceless velar stop [k] changed to the voiceless post-alveolar affricate [t É] before the high front vowel [i:], due to palatalization.

- **Introduction of Phonological Processes vs. Sound Change:**
	- The introduction of a phonological process alone doesn't constitute sound change.
	- For instance, the casual pronunciation of "accidentally" as [√¶ksIdEntli] vs. [√¶ksIdEnt@li] in formal speech doesn't represent sound change, as both variants exist simultaneously.
	- Sound change occurs when one pronunciation permanently replaces another in all contexts.

- **Example from Old English:**
	- In Old English, the word "chide" had alternate pronunciations [ki:dan] and [t Éi:dan].
	- Initially, the [t Éi:dan] pronunciation was tied to specific speech situations, similar to the casual pronunciation of "accidentally" in Modern English.
	- Over time, the [t Éi:dan] pronunciation became predominant, leading to the abandonment of [ki:dan], resulting in a permanent alteration of the word's basic form.

- **Conclusion:**
	- Sound change occurs when one pronunciation permanently replaces another in all contexts.
	- It's a gradual process that influences various aspects of language, demonstrating the dynamic nature of linguistic evolution.
## 13.3.2 Phonetic vs. Phonological Change

- **Phonetic Change:**
	- Refers to a change in the pronunciation of an allophone without affecting the phonological system.
	- Example: Evolution of the English phoneme /r/ from a trill [r] to an alveolar retroflex liquid […π] in American English. This change is purely phonetic, as it doesn't alter the distribution of /r/ in the phonological system.

- **Phonological Change:**
	- Alters the phonological system by adding or losing a phoneme, or changing the distribution of allophones.
	- Example: In Middle English, voiceless stops were not aspirated initially. A phonological change introduced aspiration, adding new allophones [p ∞], [t ∞], and [k ∞] for the phonemes /p/, /t/, and /k/.

- **Complex Changes:**
	- Sound change may involve both phonetic and phonological aspects.
	- Example: Old English /f/ was voiced between voiced sounds, creating an additional allophone [v]. Borrowings from French introduced [v] into English, resulting in a contrastive pair: /f/-[f] and /v/-[v]. This led to the creation of a new phoneme, /v/.
## 13.3.3 The Regularity of Sound Change

One of the intriguing aspects of sound change is its remarkable regularity over time. When a sound change occurs, it typically affects every instance of the sound in question consistently. For example, in Old English, the sound change [k] > [t É] before [i:] affected every word containing [k] before [i:], not just a select few.

- **Gradual Spread:**
  - Sound change doesn't happen instantaneously across all words or speakers in a community.
  - It spreads gradually, often starting from specific words or groups and gradually encompassing all possible instances.

- **Verification of Regularity:**
  - Regularity of sound change can be verified by comparing words across different stages of a language.
  - For instance, in Old English, the word "hus" pronounced [hu:s] evolved into Modern English "house" pronounced [ha äs], demonstrating the regular change [u:] > [a ä].

- **Exceptional Cases:**
  - While most sound changes are regular, exceptions can occur due to social factors or incomplete spread.
  - Rarely, a change may not complete its spread across all words, word classes, or social varieties.
  - Examples of irregular sound changes include dissimilation, insertion, and metathesis, which are not always consistent.

The assumption of regularity in sound change has been crucial for historical linguists in reconstructing ancestor languages and language families. Despite occasional irregularities, the overwhelming regularity of sound change enables linguists to trace linguistic evolution and relationships across time.
## 13.3.4 Types of Sound Change
### Types of Sound Change

Sound change can take various forms, each with distinct characteristics and effects on language evolution. Here are some common types of sound change, along with examples from English:

a. **Assimilation:**
   - Occurs when one sound becomes more like another sound.
   - Example: In Old English, voiceless fricatives became voiced between voiced sounds, as seen in the word "wulfas" pronounced [wulfas] becoming "wulvas" pronounced [wulv…ôz] in Middle English.
   - This is how modern English comes to have an alternation between [f] and [v] in the singular "wolf" vs. the plural "wolves".

b. **Dissimilation:**
   - Occurs when two similar sounds become less like each other.
   - Example: The word "fifth" [f…™fŒ∏] in some varieties undergoes dissimilation, changing the second fricative [Œ∏] to a stop [t], resulting in the pronunciation [f…™ft].

c. **Deletion:**
   - Occurs when a sound is no longer pronounced.
   - Example: In Middle English, unstressed word-final schwa [@] was deleted, as seen in "nose" [n…îÀêz…ô] becoming Modern English "nose" [no äz].

d. **Insertion:**
   - Occurs when a sound is added to the pronunciation of a word.
   - Example: In some Modern English varieties, the word "athlete" is pronounced [√¶Œ∏lit], inserting […ô] between [Œ∏] and [l].

e. **Monophthongization:**
   - Refers to changing a diphthong to a simple vowel.
   - Example: Middle English [a ä] becoming Modern English simple vowels […î] or […ë] in words like "law" [l…îÀê] and "taught" [t…îÀêt].

f. **Diphthongization:**
   - Refers to changing a simple vowel to a diphthong.
   - Example: Middle English [iÀês] becoming Modern English [a…™] in words like "ice" [a…™s].

g. **Metathesis:**
   - Refers to a change in the order of sounds.
   - Example: Old English "hros" becoming Modern English "horse," where the consonant-vowel-consonant sequence changes to a consonant-vowel-consonant sequence.

h. **Raising and Lowering:**
   - Refers to changes in the height of the tongue in vowel production.
   - Example: Middle English [oÀê] becoming Modern English [uÀê] in words like "noon" [nuÀên].

i. **Backing and Fronting:**
   - Refers to alterations in the frontness or backness of the tongue in vowel production.
   - Example: Middle English [a] becoming Modern English [√¶] in words like "calf" and "path".
