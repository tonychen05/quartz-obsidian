# 7.1 Language in Context
## 7.1.1 The Importance of Context

#### 1. Misinterpretation due to Lack of Context
- Quotations used to defend viewpoints can be misunderstood when taken out of context.
- Instances of frustration occur when personal statements are misconstrued without considering their context.
#### 2. Context Shapes Meaning
- The original context of an utterance significantly influences its intended meaning.
- Ignoring context can lead to misrepresentation of the speaker's intentions.
#### 3. Role of Pragmaticists
- Pragmaticists explore the intricate relationship between context and meaning.
- Investigating how context impacts understanding is a key aspect of pragmatic analysis.

## 7.1.2 Sentences and Utterances

#### 1. Sentences: Abstract Entities
- Sentences are phrasal expressions that convey complete ideas.
- Characteristics of sentences can be described (e.g., language, syntactic structure).
- Sentences are abstract entities, lacking the context of real-world events.

#### 2. Utterances: Real-world Events
- Utterances occur when sentences are spoken or signed, representing real events; when a sentence is used.
- An utterance is not abstract but rather an event that happens.
- Example: Speaking the sentence "There is a platypus in the bathtub" constitutes an utterance.

#### 3. Distinguishing Sentences and Utterances
- The distinction is marked typographically: sentences are italicized, while utterances are enclosed in quotations.
- Multiple utterances can stem from the same sentence, reflecting different instances of usage.
- Example: A theater play may feature the same sentence in its opening, but each performance constitutes a distinct utterance.

#### 4. Properties of Utterances
- Utterances possess additional properties beyond language and length.
- These properties include the time, place, volume, and speaker of the utterance.
- Unlike sentences, utterances exist within a specific context, influencing their interpretation and meaning.
## 7.1.3 How Context Affects Meaning
#### 1. Deictic Elements: Contextual Dependence
- Words like "he," "there," and "now" lack inherent specificity and rely on context for interpretation.
- Without context, sentences like "He is there now" are ambiguous regarding the identity, location, and time referred to.
- Example scenarios demonstrate how the same sentence could refer to various individuals, locations, and times depending on context.

#### 2. Contextual Variability of Sentences
- Any sentence can acquire diverse meanings based on the specific context in which it is uttered.
- Example: The sentence "Can you take the trash out?" can imply different intentions depending on the situation.
    - Request from a roommate.
    - Inquiry about capability from a physical therapist.
    - Expression of frustration towards a sibling.
    - Suggesting a humorous situation to a friend.
- The same sentence can have multiple interpretations, showcasing the impact of context on meaning.

#### 3. Contextual Dependency in Meaning Interpretation
- Understanding the meaning of an utterance necessitates knowledge of its context.
- Default interpretations exist for many sentences, such as assuming a request in an ordinary situation.
- However, the notion of "out-of-the-blue" interpretations emphasizes that any context, default or not, influences meaning equivalently.
## 7.1.4 Types of Context
#### 1. Linguistic Context
- Relates to preceding discourse in a conversation.
- Determines the specific meaning of utterances based on prior dialogue.
- Example: The response "Yes" varies in meaning depending on the question asked earlier.
#### 2. Situational Context
- Pertains to the immediate situation in which the utterance occurs.
- Provides information about the environment or circumstances.
- Allows referencing of entities not previously mentioned in discourse.
- Example: Mentioning "It smells" in a classroom after a goat enters clarifies the subject without prior mention.
#### 3. Semantic Variability in Situational Context
- The meaning of a sentence may vary based on the specific situation.
- Example: "The governor was on TV last night" implies different governors depending on the geographical location.
- Contextual knowledge influences interpretation without prior mention in discourse.
#### 4. Social Context
- Involves information about the relationships and roles of individuals speaking.
- Determines appropriateness of language use and interpretation.
- Example: Differentiates between respectful and sarcastic responses based on social cues.
- Guides understanding of implied meanings behind statements.
- Example: Understanding whether "Can you take out the trash?" is a request or a polite suggestion depends on social context.
#### 5. Overall Impact
- These contextual aspects, along with others, significantly contribute to understanding the meaning of utterances.
- Together, they provide critical information for interpreting language effectively in various contexts.
## 7.1.5 Felicity: Appropriateness Relative to a Context

#### 1. Felicity vs. Infelicity
- Similar to grammaticality in syntax, pragmatics considers utterances as felicitous or infelicitous.
- A felicitous utterance is situationally appropriate within the context it is spoken.
- Infelicitous utterances are inappropriate in the given context.

#### 2. Examples of Felicitous and Infelicitous Utterances
- Example (5) illustrates a felicitous response where the answer corresponds appropriately to the question.
- Examples (6) and (7) show infelicitous responses due to lack of relevant detail or relevance to the question.
- Infelicity can occur due to various reasons, not limited to insufficient detail or unrelated responses.

#### 3. Contextual Dependency of Felicity
- The appropriateness of an utterance depends on the specific context.
- Infelicitous utterances in one context may be acceptable in another.
- Felicity is not an inherent property of sentences but of their usage within a given context.

#### 4. Intuitive Understanding by Speakers
- Speakers intuitively recognize whether an utterance is felicitous or infelicitous.
- Similar to grammaticality judgments, individual perceptions of felicity may vary.
- However, general guidelines exist for determining the felicity of utterances.

#### 5. Chapter Focus on Felicity and Context
- Chapter 7 delves into determining the felicity of utterances and how context aids in understanding their meaning.
- Explores the relationship between context and the appropriateness of utterances in various situations.
# 7.2 Rules of Conversation

## 7.2.1 Rules for Conversation

#### 1. Comparison with Other Social Enterprises
- Similar to family rules for chores or traffic rules for intersections, language use is governed by social rules.
- These rules ensure respect, politeness, and effective communication.
#### 2. Protecting Communication Integrity
- Language's value depends on the ability to discern truth from lies.
- Assumptions about honesty and relevance underpin effective communication.
#### 3. The Cooperative Principle
- Formulated by philosopher H. P. Grice, the Cooperative Principle asserts that conversation assumes mutual cooperation.
- Cooperation's specifics vary based on the conversation's context.
- Business meetings demand topic relevancy, while casual conversations are more flexible.
#### 4. Conversational Maxims
- Grice proposed conversational maxims as guiding principles for interactions.
- Maxims ensure meaningful discourse and facilitate felicitous utterances.
- Examples include relevance, quantity, quality, and manner.
#### 5. Felicity of Utterances
- Utterances are felicitous when they align with Grice's maxims, promoting effective communication.
- Compliance with conversational maxims maintains coherence and relevance in discourse.

## 7.2.2 Introducing Grice's Maxims
### Grice's Maxims: Guidelines for Cooperative Discourse

#### a. Maxims of Quality
- Address expectations of honesty:
  - Do not say what you believe to be false.
  - Do not say that for which you lack adequate evidence.
- Adequate evidence varies among individuals and contexts.
- Examples illustrate the importance of context in determining evidence sufficiency.
#### b. Maxim of Relevance
- Emphasizes relevance in conversation:
  - Be relevant.
- Maintains conversation organization and coherence.
- Examples demonstrate how relevance aids in interpretation within a conversation's context.
#### c. Maxims of Quantity
- Govern the amount of information shared:
  - Make your contribution as informative as is required.
  - Do not make your contribution more informative than is required.
- Context dictates the appropriate level of informativeness.
- Examples highlight the importance of context in determining the appropriate level of information.
#### d. Maxims of Manner
- Focus on the clarity and organization of expression:
  - Avoid obscurity of expression.
  - Avoid ambiguity.
  - Be brief.
  - Be orderly.
- Clear expression facilitates understanding and coherence in discourse.
- Examples illustrate the importance of clarity and organization in conveying information effectively.
## 7.2.3 Flouting Maxims

#### Violating Maxims
- Speakers sometimes violate maxims intentionally or accidentally.
- Violations can be infelicitous but are also exploited for indirect communication.
#### Flouting Maxims
- Flouting occurs when a speaker seemingly violates a maxim but expects the listener to infer the intended meaning.
- Examples of flouting:
  - **Quantity**: Providing minimal information to convey a negative impression indirectly.
  - **Relevance**: Abruptly changing the subject to signal a sensitive topic.
  - **Quality**: Using sarcasm or exaggeration to convey disbelief or criticism indirectly.
#### Examples:
1. **Quantity**: Writing a brief, uninformative letter of recommendation to convey a negative impression.
2. **Relevance**: Abruptly changing the subject to avoid discussing a sensitive topic.
3. **Quality**: Responding sarcastically to indicate disbelief or criticize indirectly.
#### Role in Communication
- Flouting maxims is common in humor and everyday communication.
- Facilitates indirect communication but requires effort from both speaker and listener.
- Misinterpretation risk exists, especially across cultural or contextual differences.

Flouting maxims showcases the complexity and flexibility of language in conveying nuanced meanings indirectly, contributing to effective communication in various contexts.
## 7.2.4 Grice's Maxims in a Wider Context

### Balancing Grice's Maxims with Social Rules
In navigating social interactions, Grice's maxims of conversation often intersect with broader social rules concerning politeness, social harmony, and cultural norms. However, these principles are not always in perfect alignment and may sometimes conflict with each other, leading to nuanced communication strategies.
#### Politeness vs. Pragmatics
- Politeness norms sometimes dictate behaviors that diverge from pragmatic rules.
- For instance, in some cultures, giving an imprecise answer to a stranger's question may be deemed more polite than refusing to answer.

#### Social Competence
- Understanding and applying Grice's maxims require social competence rather than inherent linguistic knowledge.
- Speakers must navigate the delicate balance between pragmatic principles and broader social norms.

#### Cultural Variation
- The implementation and interpretation of Grice's maxims vary across societies.
- Different cultures may prioritize different aspects of communication, leading to varied approaches to conversation and politeness.

#### Flexibility of Conventions
- Grice's maxims are conventions rather than natural laws, allowing for flexibility and adaptation in different social contexts.
- While the essence of these maxims may be universal, their application can differ based on cultural, social, and situational factors.

In summary, Grice's maxims provide a framework for effective communication, but their application is influenced by broader social rules and cultural norms. Understanding and navigating these dynamics require social competence and awareness of contextual factors.
