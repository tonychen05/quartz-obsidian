# 6.3 Compositional Semantics: The Meaning of Sentences
## 6.3.1 Propositions and Truth Values
- **Introduction**
    - Thinking about word meanings is crucial for semantics.
    - Understanding word meanings alone isn't sufficient for complex communicative acts.
    - Need to consider phrase and sentence meanings for productive communication.
- **Reference of Sentences**
    - Sentences make specific claims or assertions about entities in the world.
    - Sentences express propositions, unlike individual words.
    - Propositions can be true or false and have truth values.
- **Evaluation of Propositions**
    - Truth values represent the relationship between the proposition expressed by a sentence and the world.
    - Truth values are determined by evaluating propositions with respect to the world.
- **Understanding Propositions**
    - Understanding a proposition involves comprehending the meaning of all words in the sentence and their syntactic combination.
    - Understanding a proposition also involves grasping its truth conditions, i.e., what the world would have to be like for it to be true.
- **Examples**
    - Example sentences illustrate how we understand propositions but may lack knowledge about their actual truth values due to incomplete information.
    - Despite uncertainty about truth values, propositions have definite truth conditions.
- **Conclusion**
    - Understanding a proposition's truth conditions is necessary to determine its truth value.
    - Lack of complete information may lead to understanding truth conditions without knowing the truth value, similar to understanding word meanings without correctly identifying their referents.

## 6.3.2 Relationships between Propositions
- **Introduction**
    - Investigating different relationships between propositions.
- **Entailment**
    - Proposition expressed by (5a) "All dogs bark" entails proposition expressed by (5b) "Sallyâ€™s dog barks."
    - In entailment, truth conditions of one proposition guarantee the truth conditions of another.
    - Example pairs illustrate entailment: (6a) entails (6b), (8a) entails (8b), (9a) entails (9b), and (10a) entails (10b).
    - Entailment is not necessarily symmetric.
        - (10a) entails (10b), but (10b) does not entail (10a).
    - Mutual entailment exists when two propositions entail each other, as in (11a) and (11b).
- **Incompatibility**
    - Some propositions are incompatible, meaning it's impossible for both to be true.
    - Example pairs of mutually incompatible propositions: (12a) and (12b), (13a) and (13b), (14a) and (14b).
- **Conclusion**
    - Understanding relationships between propositions helps in logical reasoning and semantic analysis.
    - Entailment shows how truth conditions of one proposition imply those of another.
    - Incompatibility demonstrates situations where propositions cannot coexist as true in any imaginable world.

# 6.4 Compositional Semantics: Putting Meanings Together

## 6.4.1 The Principle of Compositionality

- **Introduction**
    - Compositional semantics addresses how the meanings of larger expressions are derived from the meanings of words and their syntactic combinations.
- **Meaning Dependencies**
    - Meanings of phrases depend on the meanings of the words they contain.
    - Example: "Sally loves Polly" vs. "Polly loves Sally" demonstrates different propositions despite identical words, highlighting the importance of syntactic structure.
- **Syntactic Structure's Role**
    - Syntactic structure influences meaning.
    - Example: Ambiguity in "The cop saw the man with the binoculars" arises from different syntactic interpretations.
- **Principle of Compositionality**
    - Meaning of a sentence relies on the meanings of its constituent words and their syntactic arrangement.
    - Enables understanding of an infinite number of sentences based on lexical meanings and syntax.
    - Facilitates productivity in language.
- **Illustrative Examples**
    - Novel sentences illustrate the principle's application, demonstrating comprehension without prior exposure to specific sentences.
- **Compositionality Failure: Idioms**
    - Idiomatic expressions like "kick the bucket" have non-compositional meanings not predictable from individual word meanings and syntax.
    - Non-compositional meanings must be stored in the mental lexicon as idiomatic expressions.
- **Conclusion**
    - Majority of phrasal meanings are compositional, but idiomatic expressions deviate from this principle.
    - Understanding how word meanings combine into phrasal meanings involves consideration of syntactic structures.

## 6.4.2 Combining the Meanings of Verb Phrases and Noun Phrases
- **Introduction**
    - Sentences in English typically consist of a noun phrase (NP) and a verb phrase (VP).
    - Example phrase structure tree for the sentence "Sandy runs."
- **Process for Computing Sentence Meaning**
    - Proper names like "Sandy" refer to specific entities, while intransitive verbs like "runs" refer to sets of entities.
    - To determine the truth conditions for the proposition expressed by "Sandy runs," it must be the case that the referent of "Sandy" is a member of the set referred to by "runs."
- **Illustrative Scenario**
    - Example scenarios in a simplified world with five individuals: Kim, Robin, Lee, Sandy, and Michael.
    - Proposition expressed by "Sandy runs" is false if Sandy is not in the set referred to by "runs."
    - Proposition expressed by "Sandy runs" is true if Sandy is in the set referred to by "runs."
- **Meanings of Multi-word NPs and VPs**
    - Many expressions in NP category refer to specific individuals, while those in VP category refer to sets of individuals.
    - Examples: "The 44th president of the United States" refers to Barack Obama; "likes Bob a lot" refers to the set of individuals who like Bob a lot.
    - Propositions expressed by sentences are true if the referent of the subject NP is a member of the set referred to by the VP.
- **Examples**
    - Illustrative examples demonstrate how the truth conditions of sentences depend on the reference of NP and VP constituents.
- **Conclusion**
    - Understanding the meanings of sentences involves analyzing the reference of NP and VP constituents and their relationship.

## 6.4.3 Combining the Meanings of Adjectives and Nouns

- **Introduction**
    - Adjective-noun combinations present complex semantic composition.
    - Meanings of phrases depend on adjectives and nouns and how they combine.
- **Pure Intersection**
    - Adjectives like "green," "healthy," and "sleeping" form pure intersections.
    - Meanings combine by collecting entities that belong to both adjective and noun sets.
    - Illustrated by examples such as "green sweater" and "healthy cow."
- **Relative Intersection**
    - Adjectives like "big" and "good" form relative intersections.
    - Reference of adjectives is determined relative to the reference of the noun.
    - Examples include "big whale" and "good coffee."
- **Subsective Adjectives**
    - Subsective adjectives like "big" select a subset of the noun's reference set.
    - "Good coffee" illustrates this, where "good" refers to quality relative to the context.
- **Non-Intersection Adjectives**
    - Adjectives like "possible" and "alleged" do not necessarily refer to objects denoted by the nouns they combine with.
    - "Possible solution" and "alleged thief" exemplify non-intersection.
- **Anti-Intersection Adjectives**
    - Anti-intersection adjectives like "fake" cannot refer to objects within the reference set of the noun they combine with.
    - Example: "fake diamond."
- **Research in Compositional Semantics**
    - Researchers aim to understand and describe the differences in how adjectives and nouns combine.
    - Precise rules are necessary due to the infinite possibilities of sentences and meanings in any language.
- **Conclusion**
    - Understanding how adjectives and nouns combine helps in semantic analysis and language comprehension.
    - Rules for combining meanings must exist in our minds to comprehend and produce the infinite variety of sentences in language.
