# 10.4 Factors Influencing Variation: Social
## 10.4.1 Social Inflences on Language Variation

- **Introduction**
	- Regional and geographic factors previously explored in language variation.
	- Regional variation accounts for only a portion of the variation observed.

- **Additional Factors**
	- **Socioeconomic class:** Economic status influences language use and variation.
	- **Age:** Different age groups may exhibit distinct language patterns.
	- **Gender:** Language usage may vary between genders.
	- **Ethnicity:** Cultural background influences language variation.

- **Social Dialects**
	- Speaker characteristics tied to social groups shape language variation.
	- Reflects the influence of social factors on language within regional dialects.

- **Continued Discussion**
	- Deeper exploration of language as a social phenomenon in File 10.5.
	- Emphasis on how language marks specific social characteristics.

- **Focus Areas**
	- Examination of particular factors influencing language variety differences.
	- Analysis of examples illustrating these variations within social contexts.
## 10.4.2 Socioeconomic Variation

- **Introduction**
	- Socioeconomic class influences language variation.
	- Prestige associated with higher socioeconomic status often determines standard dialects.

- **Reasons for Influence**
	- Desire to align with a particular socioeconomic group affects language choice.
	- Language reflects solidarity or distance from different social groups.
	- Socioeconomic status linked to levels and types of education, impacting language use.

- **Study by William Labov (1972)**
	- Investigated correlation between socioeconomic status and language variety in New York City.
	- Non-rhotic speech common in NYC: non-pronunciation of /ɹ/ at the end of syllables.
	- Rhotic pronunciation associated with high socioeconomic status; non-rhotic with low socioeconomic status.
  
- **Methodology**
	- Tested salespeople in department stores with varying levels of prestige.
	- Salesclerks unaware of being tested.
	- Asked a question to elicit the answer "fourth floor" in casual speech and then requested the answer to be repeated in careful speech.

- **Results**
	- Clear stratification of rhoticity based on socioeconomic status.
	- Higher socioeconomic-class store (Saks) had the highest percentage of rhoticity.
	- Lower socioeconomic-class store (S. Klein) had the lowest percentage of rhoticity.
	- Careful speech associated with a higher percentage of rhoticity, consistent with formal register.
## 10.4.3 Age Variation

- **Introduction**
	- Language varieties differ based on age.
	- Older speakers may perceive changes in language use by younger generations as degradation.
	- Linguistically, differences between older and younger speech are natural changes, not inherently good or bad.

- **Recent Changes in English**
	- Use of "hopefully" as a sentential adverb.
	- High-rising intonation at the ends of declarative sentences ("uptalk").
	- Use of "like" as an interjection or quotative.
	- Introduction of new words like "download" and loss of older words like "dungarees."

- **Usage Patterns**
	- Younger speakers tend to adopt new variants more readily than older speakers.
	- Some innovations are adopted by both older and younger speakers.
	- Younger speakers often exhibit distinct linguistic patterns from older speakers in their communities.

- **Consistency Across Generations**
	- In rare cases, differences between older and younger speakers persist.
	- Specific linguistic forms may be consistently used by speakers of a particular age across successive generations.
## 10.4.4 Gender Variation

- **Introduction**
	- Gender influences language variation alongside region, socioeconomic class, and age.
	- Gender, as used here, refers to cultural patterns of masculinity and femininity rather than biological differences.
	- Language and gender research explores language's role in defining, constructing, and reproducing gendered identities.

- **Cultural Norms and Language**
	- Gender is linked with cultural norms for behavior, including linguistic behavior.
	- Stereotypes about language use vary across cultures.
	- Speech behaviors in different cultures associated with different genders.

- **Patterns in Language Usage**
	- Women tend to use more standard variants than men in studies of Western cultures.
	- Middle-class and women more likely to use standard language forms in studies like those in Norwich, England and Sydney, Australia.
	- Perception of gender tied to speech patterns, as seen in the Dublin study by John Edwards.

- **Explanations for Correlation**
	- Social roles influence language use more than inherent gender differences.
	- Women may imitate prestigious language to enhance social status.
	- Women's role as primary caretakers may influence language exposure for children.
	- Gender influences language due to associations with certain linguistic features.

- **Community of Practice Approach**
	- Eckert and McConnell-Ginet propose focusing on communities of practice in language and gender research.
	- Communities of practice involve people engaged in mutual endeavors.
	- Individuals construct gendered identities differently in various communities of practice.
	- Understanding gender in local contexts enhances comprehension of language-gender dynamics in the community.

## 10.4.5 Ethnic Variation

- **Introduction**
	- Ethnicity influences language variation in multi-ethnic communities.
	- Ethnic groups often associated with particular languages influencing standard language varieties.
	- Language and identity play significant roles, influencing language usage.

- **No Linguistic Superiority**
	- No language variety is inherently superior or inferior.
	- Language variation influenced by exposure rather than inherent traits.

- **African-American English (AAE)**
	- A continuum of varieties spoken primarily among African Americans.
	- Features influenced by southern dialects and West African languages.
	- Phonological, morphosyntactic, and lexical features distinguish AAE from Standard American English (SAE).

- **Chicano English**
	- Spoken by second- or third-generation speakers of Mexican descent in the United States.
	- Influenced by Spanish phonological, syntactic, and lexical features.
	- Features include vowel patterns, morphosyntactic structures, and emblematic language use.

- **Lumbee English**
	- Spoken by the Lumbee Indians, the largest Native American group east of the Mississippi River.
	- Unique phonetic features, such as pronunciation of /AI/ as [OI].
	- Morphosyntactic features include unique verb forms like "weren't" and "bes."
	- Unique lexical items reflect cultural identity and heritage, such as "ellick" for coffee with cream and sugar.

- **Conclusion**
	- Ethnic variation in language demonstrates the influence of heritage, culture, and identity on linguistic patterns.
	- Language varieties shaped by exposure, cultural norms, and social identity rather than inherent traits.

# 10.5 Language and Identity
## 10.5.1 Using Language to Mark Identity

- **Language as a Social Phenomenon**
	- Language is a strictly human phenomenon, setting humans apart from other creatures.
	- Language serves as an indicator of human uniqueness and unifies societies.
  
- **Language as a Marker of Identity**
	- Language diversity leads to its use as a marker of identity within human societies.
	- Language acquisition depends on surrounding language varieties, making it a way to show group affiliation or dissociation.

- **Lines of Language Variation**
	- Nationality, ethnicity, age, gender, socioeconomic class, etc., influence language variation.
	- No inherent traits condition language use within specific groups.

- **Group Differentiation through Language**
	- Language characteristics develop naturally among groups of speakers who identify with each other.
	- These characteristics distinguish groups and are propagated through language acquisition.

## 10.5.2 Defining "Identity"

- **Complexity of Identity**
	- Individuals often identify with multiple groups depending on circumstances.
	- Identity is dynamic and situational, influenced by context, social interactions, and goals.

- **Emergence of Identity**
	- Identity is not static but emerges from social interactions, establishing relationships with society.
	- Linguistic interactions play a significant role in defining and indicating identity.

- **Components of Identity**
	- Identity is not solely expressed through language but also through actions, practices, and characteristics.
	- Language is commonly used to establish or indicate identity, though not always consciously.

- **Unconscious Use of Language**
	- Language use may unconsciously reveal aspects of identity, such as regional origin or social status.
	- Perceptions of identity by listeners are as significant as the speaker's own perception.
	- Individuals may not have complete control over their linguistic identity, as it is influenced by societal associations and interpretations.

## 10.5.3 Signaling Identity

- **Overt Statements of Identity**
	- Explicitly stating affiliation with or dissociation from a particular group.
	- Use of gender pronouns to indicate gender identity.

- **Use of Linguistic Forms**
	- Choice of words or forms associated with a specific identity (e.g., actor/actress).
	- Linguistic characteristics associated with social groups can signal identity (e.g., regional accents, dialectal features).

- **Twists on Identity Perception**
	- Listeners may classify phonemes differently based on perceived gender.
	- Choice of language in multilingual societies can make political or social statements.

- **Inclusion and Dissociation**
	- Language use may indicate inclusion in one group or dissociation from another.
	- Choice not to speak in a certain way can also signal identity.

- **Consequences of Language Use**
	- Language stereotypes may lead to judgments about personality, abilities, etc.
	- Discrimination based on perceived ethnicity or social group can occur, as seen in housing discrimination studies.

## 10.5.4 Studying Identity

- **Early Approaches**
	- Identifying sociological factors (e.g., region, age, gender) and correlating them with linguistic variables.
	- Valuable for establishing broad characteristics but limited in determining individual identity.

- **Limitations of Early Studies**
	- Predetermined sociological factors may not capture individual identity accurately.
	- Difficulty in comparing across societies.
	- Challenges with individuals of mixed backgrounds or varied experiences.

- **Expanding Research**
	- Recent studies incorporate factors relevant to speakers' self-identification.
	- Focus on communities and groups formed around shared activities or interests.
	- Recognition of linguistic diversity within narrowly defined social environments (e.g., high school cliques).

- **Observer's Paradox**
	- Observation may alter natural speech patterns as speakers become self-conscious.
	- Participant's perception of the researcher's identity may influence speech.
	- Identity projection varies based on the context of interaction.

- **Strategies to Overcome the Paradox**
	- Use of large databases of recorded speech for analysis.
	- Discourse analysis or conversational analysis techniques to examine identity establishment in natural conversations.

- **Advantages and Disadvantages**
	- Each research technique has its own strengths and limitations.
	- Combining multiple methods provides a more comprehensive understanding of sociolinguistic identity.

## 10.5.5 Martha’s Vineyard: A Case Study in Language and Identity

- **Study Context:**
	- Conducted by William Labov in 1961 on Martha’s Vineyard to examine social patterns' impact on linguistic variation.
	- Investigated centralization of diphthongs /AI/ and /AU/ to [@I] and [@U], respectively.

- **Variables Analyzed:**
	- **Geography:** Island divided into up-island (rural) and down-island (towns) regions.
	- **Ethnicity:** Native Vineyarders categorized into English, Portuguese, Native American, and miscellaneous groups.
	- **Economic Background:** Vineyard heavily reliant on summer tourism, leading to resistance among locals.

- **Findings:**
	- Centralization observed among island residents but not among tourists or mainlanders.
	- Variation in centralization within the island population.
	- Age correlated with centralization, peaking between thirty-one and forty-five.
	- Economic pressure influenced centralization, particularly among those supporting families.
	- Portuguese and Native American populations exhibited high centralization due to their desire for acceptance and integration.

- **Language and Identity:**
	- Centralization positively correlated with speakers' identification with Martha’s Vineyard.
	- Degree of centralization reflected speakers' closeness to the island and pride in being a Vineyard native.
	- Language used to express identity consciously or unconsciously, influenced by various aspects of speakers' social and regional affiliations.
