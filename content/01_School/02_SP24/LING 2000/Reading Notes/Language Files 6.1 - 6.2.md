# 6.1 An Overview of Semantics
## 6.1.1 Lexical and Compositional Semantics
**Semantics in Linguistics**
- Semantics: Subfield of linguistics studying meaning in language.
- Subdivisions:
  - Lexical Semantics:
    - Concerned with meanings of words and other lexical expressions.
    - Includes meaning relationships among them.
  - Compositional Semantics:
    - Deals with phrasal meanings and their assembly.
- **Lexical Semantics**
  - Focus: Meanings of individual words.
  - Mental Lexicon:
    - Finite number of words with stored meanings.
- **Compositional Semantics**
  - Focus: Phrasal meanings and their construction.
  - Infinite possible sentences and phrasal expressions in language.
- **Understanding Phrasal Meanings**
  - Speakers must infer meanings based on:
    - Meanings of lexical expressions.
    - Manner of combination.

**Semanticists' Perspectives**
- **Compositional Semanticists**
  - Interest: How lexical meanings combine to form phrasal meanings.
- **Lexical Semanticists**
  - Focus: Meanings of words.

## 6.1.2 Two Aspects of Linguistic Meaning
**Two Aspects of Linguistic Meaning**
- **Sense and Reference**
  - **Sense:**
    - Mental representation or concept of an expression's meaning.
    - Includes associated images, thoughts, and related information.
    - Knowing sense entails understanding of expression's meaning.
  - **Reference:**
    - Relationship of expression to the world.
    - Identifies entities in the world referred to by the expression.
    - Understanding reference involves identifying expression's referents.

- **Sense vs. Reference**
  - **Relationship:**
    - Knowing sense doesn't guarantee ability to identify referents.
    - Expertise may be required for certain expressions.
  - **Examples:**
    - **Unicorn:**
      - Sense: Mental image of mythical creature.
      - Reference: No real-world entity corresponds.
    - **Queen of the United States:**
      - Sense: Conceptual understanding.
      - Reference: No real-world referent.
    - **Multiple Expressions, Same Referent:**
      - e.g., "Most populous country in the world" and "Second largest country in Asia" both refer to China.
      - Different senses: Population vs. geographic size.

- **Importance of Sense and Reference**
  - **Sense:**
    - Basis for mental component of linguistic meaning.
    - Essential for expressions with no referents.
  - **Reference:**
    - Connects linguistic meanings to the outside world.
    - Facilitates communication about real-world entities.
# 6.2 Lexical Semantics: The Meaning of Words
## 6.2.1 The Source of Word Meanings
**The Source of Word Meanings**

- **Perception of Meaning**
  - Commonly associated with word meanings.
  - Often involves referencing dictionaries or online sources.
  - Discussions and debates on word meanings are common.

- **Focus of Discussion**
  - Not individual word meanings but the essence of word meaning itself.

- **Dictionaries as Sources**
  - Widely perceived as the ultimate authority on word meanings.
  - Definitions provided in dictionaries are based on:
    - Words and their meanings.
    - Ease of accessibility and memorization.
  - Often accepted as more accurate than individual understandings.
  
- **Authenticity of Dictionary Definitions**
  - Derived from observations of language use by speakers.
  - New words or definitions aren't introduced solely by dictionary entries.
  - Entries are dynamic, reflecting changes in language use over time.
  - Models usage rather than dictating it.
  
- **Community as the Authority**
  - Ultimate authority on word meaning lies with native speakers.
  - True meaning determined by studying actual usage.
  - No higher authority than the community's collective understanding.
## 6.2.2 Word Senses
**The Source of Word Meanings**

- **Dictionary-Style Definitions**
  - Mental representations similar to dictionary entries.
  - Definitions in terms of other words, reflecting actual usage.
  - Problems:
    - Endless circularity in defining meanings.
    - Examples of circular definitions in dictionaries.
    - Understanding requires grasping both content and function words.
  - Limited explanatory power; merely offer paraphrases.

- **Mental Image Definitions**
  - Word meanings stored as mental images.
  - Examples evoke specific mental pictures.
  - Issues:
    - Different individuals may have varied mental images for the same word.
    - Mental images may not encompass all aspects of word meanings.
    - Prototype bias: Default mental images may not represent all instances accurately.
    - Many words lack clear mental images.

- **Usage-Based Definitions**
  - Sense of a word defined by its usage in conveying meaning or grammatical relationship.
  - Knowledge of word usage indicates understanding.
  - Applies to both content and function words.
  - Regardless of mental representation form, understanding entails recognizing appropriate usage contexts.

- **Conclusion**
  - Defining the sense of a word is challenging.
  - Sense may involve a mental concept, yet specifics remain unclear.
  - Knowledge of usage conditions essential for understanding word meanings.

## 6.2.3 Word Reference
**Types of Word Reference**

- **Proper Names**
  - Refer to specific entities:
    - e.g., "China" refers to the country, "Barack Obama" refers to the individual.
  - Directly denote particular individuals or places.

- **Common Nouns**
  - Refer to sets or categories of entities:
    - e.g., "cat" refers to the set of all cats.
  - Focus attention on entities within the specified category.

- **Illustration with Common Nouns**
  - **Example:**
    - Question: "Does Sally have a cat?"
    - Answer: "No, Sally has never had a cat."
  - **Interpretation:**
    - "Cat" directs attention to the set of all cats.
    - Question inquires about Sally's possession within this set.

- **Representation with Diagrams**
  - Visual depiction of reference:
    - e.g., diagram showing the reference of "woman" as the set of all women.
  - Clarifies that nouns refer to sets of actual individuals, not the diagram itself.

- **Distinctive References**
  - **Complex Noun Phrases:**
    - Specific referents derived from combinations with other expressions.
  - **Example:**
    - "Sally's cat" refers to a particular cat owned by Sally.
    - "The first woman to win a Nobel Prize" refers specifically to Marie Curie.

- **Intransitive Verbs and Adjectives**
  - **Verbs:**
    - Refer to sets of entities performing the action:
      - e.g., "swim" refers to the set of all swimmers.
  - **Adjectives:**
    - Refer to sets of entities possessing the quality:
      - e.g., "purple" refers to the set of all purple things.

- **Expanding Perspectives**
  - Various types of reference beyond those mentioned.
  - Diagrams aid in visualizing word reference.
  - Next section delves into different types of meaning relations between words.
## 6.2.4 Meaning Relationships
**Semantic Relationships Between Words**

a. **Hyponymy:**
   - **Definition:** Word X is a hyponym of word Y if the set referred to by X is always included in the set referred to by Y.
   - **Example:** "Poodle" is a hyponym of "dog," as all poodles are dogs.
   - **Visual Representation:** Diagrams illustrate the hierarchical relationship between words.

b. **Synonymy:**
   - **Definition:** Two words are synonymous if they have exactly the same reference.
   - **Example:** "Couch" and "sofa" are synonyms, referring to the same set of objects.
   - **Explanation:** Synonymous words may have slightly different senses but refer to identical sets of entities.

c. **Antonymy:**
   - **Definition:** Words with related meanings but contrasting senses.
   - **Types:**
     1. **Complementary Antonyms:** Two words where everything falls into one category or the other, but not both.
     2. **Gradable Antonyms:** Represent points on a continuum, allowing for degrees between the extremes.
     3. **Reverses:** Pairs suggesting movement where one word undoes the action implied by the other.
     4. **Converses:** Opposing points of view or perspectives requiring both members of the pair for reference.
   - **Examples:** 
     - Complementary: "Married/unmarried"
     - Gradable: "Wet/dry"
     - Reverses: "Expand/contract"
     - Converses: "Lend/borrow"

Understanding these semantic relationships helps in analyzing word meanings and their associations within a language.
