# 10.1 Language Varieties
## 10.1.1 Languages, Dialects, and Idiolects
### Languages, Dialects, and Idiolects
- **Language Variety**
    - Used to refer to any form of language characterized by systematic features.
    - Can refer to distinct languages, particular forms spoken by specific groups, individual speech, or contextual speech.
- **Idiolects**
    - All native speakers have their own idiolect, differing systematically from others.
- **Sociolinguistics**
    - Study of relationship between language varieties and social structures, and interrelationships among different language varieties.
- **Dialects**
    - Any variety of a language spoken by a group, characterized by systematic differences from other varieties in structure or lexicon.
    - Every person speaks a dialect of their native language.
- **Accent**
    - Refers to systematic phonological variation, not just pronunciation.
    - Every person speaks with an accent.
- **Speech Community**
    - Group of people speaking the same dialect.
    - Defined by extralinguistic factors like region, socioeconomic status, age, gender, and ethnicity.
- **Language Variation**
    - Often influenced by regional, social, and cultural factors.
    - Speech communities rarely speak "pure" dialects due to interaction of various factors.

### Distinguishing Dialects and Languages
- **Mutual Intelligibility**
    - Criterion to distinguish dialects from languages.
    - If speakers of one variety can understand speakers of another, they're dialects of the same language.
- **Complications**
    - Cultural, political, geographical, or historical considerations may affect classification.
    - Dialect continuum: adjacent dialects may be intelligible but distant ones not.
- **Perception**
    - Native speakers' perception crucial in distinguishing dialects and languages.

## 10.1.2 Style and Register
- **Idiolects and Contextual Speech**
    - Every speaker has their own idiolect.
    - Speech differs in various contexts.
    - Some utterances may be inappropriate due to social context.
- **Speech Styles**
    - Systematic variations based on factors like topic, setting, and addressee.
    - Can range from playful to strictly formal.
    - Different levels of formality known as registers.
- **Style Shifting**
    - Automatic adjustment from one speech style to another.
    - Effortlessly modifying language and manners based on the situation.
- **Adapting Speech Styles**
    - Not insincere or playacting, but choosing the appropriate style for the audience.
    - Analogous to choosing the right tool for a specific task.
## 10.1.3 Jargon and Slang
- **Jargon**
    - Technical language differing mainly in lexical items.
    - Found in every job, field of study, hobby, or sport.
    - Clear, expressive, and economical within its area, but often incomprehensible to outsiders.
    - Often used to impress those outside the profession with specialized terminology.
    - Examples: "rhinitis" for "a runny nose," "rhinoplasty" for "nose job," "dermatitis" for "rash."
- **Escaping Jargon**
    - Sometimes technical terms enter general use.
    - Examples: "bottom line," "hardware," "software," "cool," "countdown," "strike out."
- **Slang**
    - Stylistic choices in vocabulary, less formal than equivalent words.
    - Two types: common slang (e.g., "fridge" for "refrigerator") and in-group slang (specific to a particular group at a particular time).
    - In-group slang used to maintain group cohesion and exclude outsiders.
    - Constant turnover and renewal of slang expressions.
    - Some slang becomes widely accepted over time (e.g., "fan" from "fanatic").
    - Serves a creative and group membership display function in language use.
    - Present in all languages throughout history.

## 10.1.4 Standard Dialects and Notions of Prestige

- **Equivalence of Dialects**
    - All dialects are linguistically equivalent; misconceptions arise from social stereotypes and biases.
    - Use of a particular dialect does not reflect intelligence or judgment; no dialect or language is inherently better or worse.
- **Standard Dialect**
    - Often used by political leaders, media, and higher socioeconomic classes.
    - Taught in schools and language classes; serves as primary means of communication across dialects.
    - Not inherently superior; tied to prestige of speakers rather than linguistic superiority.
- **Changes in Standard**
    - Standard features may change over time; influenced by societal opinion rather than linguistic principles.
    - Example: shift of multiple negation from standard to nonstandard.
- **Standard American English (SAE)**
    - Not a well-defined variety; comprises various dialects, primarily characterized by grammar rather than pronunciation.
    - Pronunciation differences may exist but are tolerated to some extent.
- **Nonstandard Varieties**
    - Referred to as nonstandard, not necessarily substandard or inferior.
    - Often stigmatized, leading to misconceptions about speakers' intelligence or ambition.
    - Adjustment to standard variety required in certain social contexts, leading to bidialectalism or rejection of nonstandard dialect.
- **Prestige and Group Identification**
    - Overt prestige associated with standard dialects; covert prestige associated with nonstandard varieties within specific communities.
    - Language serves as a marker of group identification; discussed further in relation to language and identity and language and power.
# 10.2 Variation at Different Levels of Linguistic Structure

## 10.2.1 Variation at All Levels
- **Introduction**
    - Conscious awareness often focuses on vocabulary choice or pronunciation.
    - Internal variation exists across all linguistic structures: phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics.
- **Phonetics**
    - Differences in articulation and production of speech sounds.
    - Example: Pronunciation of vowels or consonants may vary between dialects or languages.
- **Phonology**
    - Differences in the organization of speech sounds into phonological systems.
    - Example: Contrasts in vowel length or consonant clusters may vary between dialects.
- **Morphology**
    - Differences in the structure and formation of words.
    - Example: Varied use of inflectional or derivational morphemes in different dialects.
- **Syntax**
    - Differences in the arrangement and combination of words to form sentences.
    - Example: Variances in word order or sentence structure between languages or dialects.
- **Semantics (Lexicon)**
    - Differences in meaning and vocabulary.
    - Example: Variation in word meanings or usage across regions or social groups.
- **Pragmatics**
    - Differences in the pragmatic conventions of speakers.
    - Example: Varied use of politeness strategies or conversational implicatures between cultures or social groups.

## 10.2.2 Phonetic Variation
- **Definition**
    - Phonetics studies how sounds are physically produced, acoustics of sound waves, and perception by the brain.
    - Differences at this level involve variations in physical characteristics of sounds that function similarly in linguistic systems.
- **Examples**
    - **Place of Articulation**
        - Some American English dialects produce /t, d, n, s, z/ as dental, while others as alveolar.
        - British and Scottish dialects may have a trilled [r], while most American dialects have a retroflex or bunched approximant [ɹ].
- **Individual Differences**
    - Variations occur even when the same person says the same sentence twice due to slight differences in pronunciation, duration, tone, etc.
    - Differences are more pronounced between different speakers.
- **Stylistic Variation**
    - Different styles or registers of speech exhibit phonetic variations.
    - Example: Clear enunciation in formal situations involves modifying pronunciation while maintaining the same phonological system.
        - E.g., pronouncing "little" with [t] and schwa instead of a flap and syllabic [l] to enhance clarity.
- **Example from ASL**
    - In American Sign Language (ASL), different versions of signs exist for informal and formal contexts.
    - Example: The sign for "KNOW" may involve fingers touching the cheekbone informally, but touching the temple in the "official" version used in formal settings.

## 10.2.3 Phonological Variation
- **Definition**
    - Phonology deals with the system of sounds in a language and their distribution.
    - Differences at this level involve variations in phonemes used in words, sound sequences allowed, and application of phonological rules.
- **Examples**
    - **Vowel Differences**
        - Many American dialects distinguish between [O] and [A] in words like "caught" and "cot", while some dialects have them homophonous.
        - Southern England dialects distinguish between [] and [U] in words like "flood" and "full", whereas northern English dialects use [U] for both sets of words.
- **Allowed Sound Sequences**
    - Spanish does not allow sequences like /sp/, /st/, or /sk/ at the beginning of words, whereas English does.
    - Non-rhotic English varieties like Standard British English and Boston English do not permit vowel-/r/-consonant sequences, unlike rhotic varieties.
- **Variation in Application of Phonological Rules**
    - Different varieties may have different phonological rules or apply them differently.
    - Example: In most American English dialects, /t/ is realized as [ɾ] in words like "writer", while some British English dialects realize it as [?] instead.
- **Varieties**
    - African-American English varieties may prohibit sequences like consonant-/r/ or consonant-/l/, especially in unstressed syllables.
- **Effects**
    - Variation in phonology affects pronunciation and perception, leading to differences in how words are articulated and understood across dialects and languages.

## 10.2.4 Morphological Variation
- **Definition**
    - Morphological variation involves differences in the distribution of morphemes or the use of different morphemes for the same function in different varieties of a language.
- **Examples**
    - **Variation in Suffix Use**
        - In some varieties of English, the suffix "-ish" has a wider distribution and can attach to adverbs, additional nouns, proper nouns, and even phrases.
        - Standard American English (SAE) typically uses "-like" or phrases to convey similar meanings.
    - **Different Morphemes for the Same Function**
        - In some dialects, reflexive pronouns are formed using possessive determiners for all persons, e.g., "hisself" instead of "himself".
        - Variation in past tense forms, such as "climbed" vs. "clum" in Appalachian English for the verb "climb".
    - **Variation in Past Tense Forms**
        - Within Standard American English, variations like "dived" and "dove" for the past tense of "dive", or "dragged" and "drug" for the past tense of "drag", are observed.
- **Effects**
    - Morphological variation affects the structure of words and their meanings, leading to differences in how certain grammatical functions are expressed across dialects and languages.
## 10.2.5 Syntactic Variation
- **Definition**
    - Syntactic variation involves differences in the syntactic categories of words, their properties, and how words are combined to form phrases and sentences across language varieties.
- **Examples**
    - **Auxiliary Verbs**
        - In some southern American English varieties, "done" functions as an auxiliary verb, e.g., "she done already told you", while Standard American English uses "has", e.g., "she has already told you".
    - **Adjective Modification**
        - In many Appalachian English dialects, "right" can occur before adjectives, e.g., "a right good meal", whereas Standard American English uses "very", e.g., "a very good meal".
    - **Modal Combinations**
        - Southern dialects may use combinations like "might could", "might would", "may can", and "useta could", which are not used in Standard American English, where alternative expressions are employed.
    - **Verb Complements**
        - Some Midwestern American dialects allow constructions like "the crops need watered" or "the cat wants petted", while Standard American English prefers "to be" phrases or progressive verb forms, e.g., "the crops need to be watered" or "the cat wants to be petted".
    - **Subject Pro-drop Languages**
        - Pro-drop languages like Spanish allow subject noun phrases to be omitted, e.g., "hablo español" or "yo hablo español", meaning 'I speak Spanish'. The choice may depend on context or stylistic considerations.
- **Effects**
    - Syntactic variation affects how sentences are structured and interpreted across different language varieties, contributing to differences in grammar and communication patterns.

## 10.2.6 Lexical Variation
- **Definition**
    - Lexical variation refers to differences in the vocabulary used by speakers of different language varieties to mean the same thing or to refer to the same object. It can also involve differences in the meanings of the same word across different varieties.
- **Examples**
    - **Regional Variation**
        - In the United States, words for sweet carbonated beverages vary: "soda" in the northeast and west, "pop" in the Midwest and northwest, and "coke" in the south. Other terms like "soft drink", "soda pop", "fizzy drinks", or "juice" are used elsewhere.
    - **Variation in Different Languages**
        - In European French, the word for 'to mail' is "poster", while in Québécois French, it is "maller".
        - In Taiwan Sign Language, different signs are used for the word "SHOE" depending on the region.
    - **Differences in Meaning**
        - "Knock up" means 'to rouse from sleep by knocking' in British English but 'to make pregnant' in American English.
        - "To be pissed" means 'to be drunk' in British English but 'to be mad' in American English.
    - **Stylistic Variation**
        - Different words may be chosen based on the register or style of speech. For example, "I fell on my ass" may be used with friends, while "I fell on my backside" may be used with a grandmother.
        - Different words may be used for 'man' in French depending on formality: "homme" (standard), "monsieur" or "gentilhomme" (formal), "mec" or "type" (casual).
- **Effects**
    - Lexical variation reflects cultural and regional differences in language use and can influence communication and social interactions.
    - It can also impact stylistic choices and register in speech, as well as perceptions of formality and informality.
- **Note**
    - Variation can also occur in the compositional construction of larger expressions, but this is more complex and interconnected with syntactic and pragmatic variation.

# 10.3 Factors Influencing Variation: Regional and Geographic

## 10.3.1 Why Does Language Vary?

#### Introduction:
- Language variation is widespread, ranging from major differences between languages to minor differences within dialects.
- Varieties of language can differ in phonetic, phonological, morphological, syntactic, and lexical aspects.
#### Factors Influencing Language Variation:
- **Regional and Geographic Factors**:
	- Regional dialect variation is influenced by factors like geography.
- **Social Factors**:
	- Social class, age, gender, and ethnicity contribute significantly to social dialect variation.
#### Examples of Influence:
- Various factors interact to determine the language variety used by individuals:
	- Consideration of a 13-year-old African American middle-class female from Alabama conversing with different people:
		- School friends
		- Grandmother on the phone
		- Mother
		- Cousin from New York
		- White 85-year-old neighbor from Minnesota
		- 20-year-old brother
		- 60-year-old grandmother
#### Conclusion:
- Multiple factors interact to shape the language variety used by speakers at any given time.
## 10.3.2 Regional and the Geographic Variation
#### Definition:
- Regional variation refers to language differences based on geographical boundaries.
#### Examples:
- Differences between American English and British English.
- Distinct variations within a country, such as New York English vs. Texan English.
- Example in American Sign Language (ASL) with different signs for "FOOTBALL" in Ohio compared to elsewhere in the United States.

#### Influence of Geography:
- Proximity influences dialect development more than sheer geographical distance.
- Settlement patterns, rather than geographical features, significantly impact dialect formation.
- Example: Southeastern Pennsylvania's dialect influenced by the large population of German speakers who settled in the area.

#### Impact of Physical Geography:
- Isolation from other language varieties allows for unique dialect development.
- Examples: Tangier Island off the coast of Virginia, Sea Islands of South Carolina, and Appalachian English influenced by geographical isolation.

#### Methodology of Studying Regional Dialects:
- Dialectologists conduct fieldwork to determine dialect regions.
- They identify characteristic linguistic features and directly inquire about them from people in those areas.

#### Mapping Dialect Boundaries:
- Fieldwork results are plotted on maps, with boundaries marked by lines called isoglosses.
- Bundles of isoglosses indicate significant differences in speech among neighboring groups.
- Example: Map of the northeastern United States showing isoglosses marking dialect boundaries between Northern and Midland dialect areas.
## 10.3.3 A Case Study in Regional Variation: The United States
### Key Points: A Case Study in Regional Variation: The United States

#### Historical Development of Regional Dialects:
- US regional dialects originated from English settlers from various regions of England who settled along the Eastern seaboard.
- Settlement patterns from England influenced dialectal boundaries, with certain colonial cities like Boston, Philadelphia, and Charleston gaining prestige and influencing nearby settlements.

#### Westward Migration and Influence:
- Westward migration reflected settlement patterns of the Atlantic states.
- Migration from New England and upstate New York to the Great Lakes area.
- Migration from the Middle Atlantic region (e.g., Pennsylvania, Maryland) to Ohio, West Virginia, and the Mississippi Valley.
- Influence from southern Atlantic colonies felt in the Gulf states.
- Migration patterns mingled, leading to complex dialect formations.

#### Influence of Other Factors:
- Contact between English and Native American languages in the 17th century contributed to dialect development.
- Arrival of European immigrants (e.g., French in New Orleans, German in southern Pennsylvania, Spanish in the Southwest) influenced regional dialects.
- Arrival of African slaves along the southeast Atlantic seaboard contributed to the development of southern varieties of English.
- Later migration of African Americans from rural areas to northern cities had a significant impact on modern American English dialects.

#### Modern Dialect Regions:
- Approximate boundaries of major modern dialect regions are shown.
- Despite the impact of broadcast media, regional dialects persist, especially in working-class speech.
- Early settlement patterns on the East Coast played a significant role in shaping dialects, leading to continued heterogeneity.

#### Supra-Regional Dialect Areas:
- Brief discussion of present-day supra-regional dialect areas: North, New England, South, Appalachia, Midland, and West.
- Descriptions mainly reflect Euro-American speech patterns, with acknowledgment of other ethnic groups' varieties.
