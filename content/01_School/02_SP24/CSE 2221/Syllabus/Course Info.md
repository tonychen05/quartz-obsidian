This term we will be using Microsoft Teams for class discussion. Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff, I encourage you to post your questions on Teams. To join the CSE 2221 - SP 2024 team, download and run MS Teams, log in with your OSU Buckeyemail address, select "Join or create a team", and then in the box labeled "Join a team" enter the code **nf51ufd** (you may want to copy and paste it from here to avoid mistyping it).
