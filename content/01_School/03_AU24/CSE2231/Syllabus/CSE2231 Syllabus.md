**Prerequisites:** 2122, 2123, or 2221; and Math 1151, or 1161. Concur (for students with credit for 2221): 2231.

**Grading Policy:**

20% Homework -- 25% Exam 1 -- 25% Exam 2 -- 30% Final Exam

**Letter grade guideline:** The final course grades will be on a curve which will be determined at the end of the semester, however, after each exam or homework, I may apply a curve. 

Following is a guideline that students can use to assess their approximate grade standing:

- Top 25% of the class is guaranteed A or A+
- Total grade above 85 is guaranteed A or A+
- Total grade above 70 is guaranteed a grade of B or above
- Total grade above 60 or within the top 75% of the class is guaranteed a grade of C or above
- If a student's grade is both in the bottom 10% of the class and their total grade is below 50, then the student is at risk of not passing. 

Course statistics will be posted after each exam

**Homeworks:**  Homework assignments will be posted on Canvas approximately 7 days before they are due at a varying frequency of between once every 7 to 14 days. The homework assignments are graded by a grader assigned by the department, however, if you have questions about your graded assignments, please reach out to the grader first, and then the instructor (if the issue hasn't been resolved). 

**Late Homework Policy:** **No late homework will be accepted.**

**Collaboration Policy:** You may discuss homeworks with your classmates. Collaboration does not mean copying someone else’s solution: Discuss the solutions, understand the ideas and give your own rendering. The same policy goes for using other resources such as books, online forums, Wikipedia, etc. Simply copying solutions from any source is considered plagiarism and necessary steps will be taken in case of noticing such instances.

**Makeup Policy:** Make-up exams or assignments will only be allowed for students who have a substantiated excuse approved by the instructor before the due date. **Please be advised that no make-up tests will be given unless an acceptable reason with appropriate documentation is provided.**

**Attendance:** It is important that you attend and participate in classes. By not attending a class the student may miss important information about the course material.

If a student needs to miss several days of class because of illness or other problems, it has to be due to a substantiated excuse approved by the instructor. Students should consult with their faculty advisor for any anticipated extended leaves. Note that vacations and interviews are not considered excused absences.

**Accommodations for Students with Disabilities**

If you would like to request academic accommodations based on the impact of a disability qualified under the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, contact your instructor privately as soon as possible to discuss your specific needs. Discussions are confidential. In addition to contacting the instructor, please contact the Student Life Disability Services at 614-292-3307 or [slds@osu.edu](mailto:slds@osu.edu) to register for services and/or to coordinate any accommodations you might need in your courses at The Ohio State University.
