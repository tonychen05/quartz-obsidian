# Topics:
[[Environmental Sciences]]
- Environment - specific set of physical and biological conditions in a given time and space that support the growth, development, and reproduction of life
	- Composed of physical and biological environment
		- Physical = incoming radiant energy of the sun, air, water, and soil minerals, all of which are required for life on Earth
		- Biological = encompasses organic molecules (C-H bonds), organisms, and their relationships with one another
- Environmental Science is interdisciplinary study of humanity's relationship with other organisms and Earth
- relies on a combination of natural and social sciences, and humanities to better understand the planet and to discover solutions to environmental problems
- **fundamental science** based on **empirical science**
- an applied science
- environmental literacy = understanding natural systems and environmental problems in order to make informed decisions involving sustainability and the environment
- *anthropogenic* = caused by or related to human action
- *wicked problems* = problems that are difficult or impossible to solve due to scale and complexity
	- multifaceted:
		- many causes
		- many consequences
		- many possible actions
		- opinion differ between groups
- *triple bottom line* = considering the combination of environmental, social, and economic impacts of our choices and decisions
- *social traps* = decisions that seem good in the short-term but lead to negative outcomes in the long-term
	- consumers want fish -> catch more fish -> fish population reduce
- **Three common social traps:**
	- tragedy of the commons: shared natural resources are not owned by anyone but individuals who try to maximize benefit harm the resource for everyone
		- open range, cows roam freely, if one farmer adds 100 cows, open range degraded, no grass for cow
	- time delay: time shifts a natural resource from positive to negative over time as it not able to be regenerated at a fast enough rate
		- cutting trees too fast -> deforestation
	- sliding reinforcer: solution that are helpful at first but become more harmful over time
		- pesticide -> pesticide-resistant bugs -> need better pesticide -> more bugs

US environmental history ([[United States Environmental History]]):
- early inhabitants (pre-1500)
	- indigenous population, conscious of nature, understood place in ecosystem
	- experts in hunting and gathering
- colonization and westward expansion (1600s - Late 1800s)
	- europeans first settled, vast land seen as unending supply of natural resources to exploit
	- settlers moved west and began claiming land, planting crops, harvesting timber, and hunting wildlife
	- Idea of "Manifest Destiny" forced indigenous communities out, slaughters bison (to near extinction), and other native species
- resource management and preservation (late 1800s - early 1900)
	- at the end of 19th centruy, negatives effects of expansion became more prevalent and preservation became evident
	- lands set aside to create national parks, environmentally focused gov agencies and groups were formed
	- early naturalists and writers helped form these decisions
- pollution concerns (1960s - 1980s)
	- in the 1960s and 1970s US began to see effects of pollution
	- increase in manufacturing, use and discharge of toxic chemical into the air and water
	- saw increase in environmental disasters like oil spills and river fires (Cuyahoga River in Ohio caught fire over a dozen times in the 1960s from oil being dumped into the river)
	- in the early 1970s landmark laws were passed by the US congress: Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, and Endangered Species Act. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was created in 1970.
- Environmental Movements and NGOs (1970s - 1980s)
	- birth of modern environmental movement
	- variety of environmal non-governmental agencies (NGOs) were formed, operating on local, national, and international scales to represent a wide variety of environmental issues
- International efforts (1980s - Today)
	- conventions have been held over time to develop international agreements to work towards international environmental improvements
		- Montreal Protocol (1987) - focused on Earth's ozone layer; scientists believe the hole will be completely healed by 2050
		- Paris Climate Accords (2016) - agreement between 196 countries to limit mean global temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels
			- four major players: US, China, India, and EU account of 70% of ALL greenhous gas emitions

Human impact on the planet([[Human Impact on the Planet]]):
- global atmospheric CO2 levels have increased over the past 150 years. In 2021, the concentration is approximately 410 ppm
- annual increase of atmospheric CO2 over the past 60 years is 100 times faster than caused by natural processes
- *Planetary Boundaries Framework* = idea that Earth's process contain environmental boundaries in which levels of human impact can be measured to keep us within safe zones
	- As of 2009, three boundaries, climate crisis, biodiversity loss, and nitrogen cycle have already been crossed and aren't sustainable. Ocean acidification, freshwater use, and deforestation are also concerns
- *Ecological Footprint* = measurement of the land required to product the resources we need and absorb the waste we product as an individual or as a community
- *Carrying Capacity* = population size that an area can support indefinitely
- What does a sustainable system look like?
	- Renewable Energy
	- Recycling Matter
	- Population Control
	- Local Biodiversity
	- **Obstacles to Sustainable Systems**:
		- unsustainable development: trade-off between short-term gain and long-term costs
		- wealth inequality: 20% of people controls 80% of Earth's resources

Environmental Ethics: branch of philosphy that seeks to understand the moral relationship of human beings to the vironment and its non-human elements

Three different worldviews:
- anthropocentric worldview = human lives and needs are most important
- biocentric worldview = all life (biotic factors) have an intrinsic value and should be protected
- ecocentric worldview = the entire ecosystem is most important including all biotic and abiotic factors (water, air, minerals, energy)
