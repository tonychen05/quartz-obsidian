# Topics: 
- Science = knowledge and understanding of the natural universe based on facts learned from experiments and observations
- Science as a body of knowledge is ALWAYS changing and is the **process** of discovering
- Scientific Method
	- 1. Recognize an unexplained occurrence or ask a question
	- 2. Develop a hypothesis to explain the occurrence
		- Hypothesis = a proposed explanation for an observed phenomenon
	- 3. Design and perform experiments that test hypothesis
	- 4. Analyze and interpret data to reach conclusion
	- 5. Share knowledge with scientific community and public
		- Publish research article in a journal, give research presentation at a conference
- Hypothesis
	- a statement, not a question
	- Characteristics of a well-developed hypothesis:
		- testable and falsifiable (experiment that disproves the idea in question)
		- logical (informed by previous experiments and observations)
		- specific
	- Forming a hypothesis:
		- make observations and collect data -> ask a question -> form a hypothesis that answers the question
		- empirical observations are derived from experience or experiments and provide us with information that can be detected with our senses or with instruments and equipment that enhance our senses (e.g., microscopes and telescopes)
		- inferences = conclusions based on observations, evidence, and reasoning
- Theory
	- an explanation of a natural phenomenon that is widely accepted, is supported by data and has been extensively and rigorously tested
- Level of Certainty
	- can never achieve 100% absolute proof
	- hypothesis can be disproven rather than hypotheses can be proved
	- observations -> hypothesis -> theory -> law
- Variables
	- independent variable = variable that is manipulated (amount of Vitamin C given to a child)
	- dependent variable = variable that is affected by/responds to the independent variable (the scientist observes whether a child who takes Vitamin C gets the flu)
	- control variable = part of the experiment that the scientists wants to remain constant (same diet: calories, meats, vegetables, grains)
- Test Group and Control Group
	- test group (experimental) = the group that is exposed to the independent variable and is changed or manipulated
	- control group (placebo) = group is separated and isolated so that the independent variable cannot influence it
	- For example, children in the test group drink a small can of coca-cola containing 100mg of Vitamin C. Children in control group drink a small can of coca-cola containing no Vitamin C.
- precautionary principle = acting in a cautious way by providing a margin of safety when outcomes are uncertain, or actions can have serious consequences
	- for example, the FDA will only approve a vaccine for use after it has passed through a rigorous scientific and regulatory review process for quality, safety, and effectiveness
- Sharing scientific results
	- the scientific process is complete when a scientist reports their findings to the public
		- publishing research articles in peer-reviewed journals
		- presenting their research at conferences, universities, and other professional venues
		- publishing their work in other media outlets such as books, documentaries, podcasts
- scientific literacy = the knowledge and understanding of scientific concepts and processes required for personal decision making, participation in civic and cultural affairs, and economic productivity
- Sources of information:
	- primary source = a source of information that presents original data and original research from a firsthand account (e.g., journal article)
		- research article published in a professional journal and authored by scientists who conducted the research
		- patent
		- eyewitness account (interview, photograph)
		- artwork
		- autobiography
		- organization record, report or account
	- peer review = a process used by scientific journals where a scientist's work is evaluated by experts to determine whether it is of a high enough quality to be published in a journal as an article
		- done to ensure that research is original, that experiments are conducted in an appropriate manner
	- secondary source = source of information that are not first-hand accounts but rather have been filtered or interpreted by another person, these sources are typically reviewed by an editor prior to publication, as opposed to going through a peer-review process like journal articles
		- magazine, newspaper, textbooks, documentaries and podcasts, websites, television news reports
		- typically dont pass through a peer review process
		- typically easier to read
		- do not provide the level of technical detail that is reported in a primary source
	- tertiary sources = sources of information that further digest, interpret and report information from primary and secondary sources
		- wikipedia, guidebooks, blogs, social media
Example Case Study: the ozone hole
