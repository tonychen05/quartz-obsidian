The wet scavenging of air pollutants through artificial precipitation enhancement: A case study in the Yangtze River Delta (https://www.webofscience.com/wos/alldb/full-record/WOS:000873931900001)
**Abstract:**
In this study, the impact of artificial precipitation enhancement operation on the wet scavenging of air pollutants is investigated based on an aircraft precipitation enhancement operation in the Yangtze River Delta region of China on 1 November 2020. Multiple measurement data are used, including the regional meteorological and environmental data and the comprehensive field observation data at the Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology (NUIST) campus site. The results show that the affected areas of this operation cover part of Anhui and Jiangsu provinces. The precipitation ratio between the target and contrast areas is always greater than 1, indicating the effectiveness of the seeding operation of silver iodide for precipitation enhancement. The regional analysis of air pollutants suggests that the enhanced precipitation can prevent the increase of air pollutants, especially for the particulate matter. The impact of enhanced precipitation on regional trace gases is complex because they are easily affected by the primary emissions. More data analysis at NUIST indicates that two cloud layers appear before the precipitation and merge into one thick cloud layer during the precipitation likely due to the impact of catalysis operation on the upper cloud. After the precipitation, the number concentration of aerosols with a diameter lower than 300 nm reduces significantly, the mass concentration of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 mu m decreases by about 39%, and the mass concentrations of nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide also decrease in different degrees. These results indicate that it is effective to reduce air pollutants by artificial precipitation enhancement. More studies are needed in the future.

Method for verifying increase in precipitation i.e. artificial increase in snow, for securing representative water resources for drought in e.g. China, involves obtaining two pieces of observation information from upwind area and downwind area after seeding experiment, respectively (https://www.webofscience.com/wos/alldb/full-record/DIIDW:202375798L)
**Abstract**:
NOVELTY - The method involves obtaining two pieces of observation information from an upwind area and a downwind area after a seeding experiment, respectively. The first piece of observation information is compared with the second piece of information to determine whether or not the first piece falls within a linear scope based on the second piece of observation information. Determination is made that an effect resulting from the experiment is proved when the first information falls within the linear scope. A cloud having a different feature flowed into one of the upwind and downwind areas is decided when the pieces deviate from the scope.

USE - Method for verifying an increase in precipitation i.e. artificial increase in snow, for securing representative water resources for a drought in U.S.A, China and Israel.

ADVANTAGE - The method enables accurately verifying an effect resulting from the seeding experiment and ensuring that minute physical change in the cloud occurring due to seeding is proved by utilization of a cloud physics-based observation equipment, which is mounted into an experimental aircraft, so that scientific reliability can be enhanced.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a system for verifying an increase in precipitation.

DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a schematic view for explaining a seeding line and a direction of the wind which are shown in case of an artificial rainfall.

**Source Name**: Comprehensive Efficiency Evaluation of Aircraft Artificial Cloud Seeding in Hunan Province, China, Based on Numerical Simulation Catalytic Method (https://www.webofscience.com/wos/alldb/full-record/WOS:001034887600001)
**Abstract**:
Aircraft cloud seeding refers to the use of equipment on aircraft to release chemicals into clouds, changing their physical and chemical properties to increase rainfall or snowfall. The purpose of precipitation enhancement is to alleviate drought and water scarcity issues. Due to the complexity of the technology, the precise control of factors such as cloud characteristics and chemical release amounts is necessary. Therefore, a scientific evaluation of the potential of aircraft cloud seeding can help to improve the effectiveness of the process, and is currently a technical challenge in weather modification. This study used the mesoscale numerical model WRF coupled with a catalytic process to simulate and evaluate the seven aircraft cloud seeding operations conducted in Hunan Province in 2021. The results show that WRF can effectively evaluate the effectiveness of cloud seeding. When the water vapor conditions are suitable, the airborne dispersion of silver iodide (AgI) can significantly increase the content of large particles of high-altitude ice crystals, snow, and graupel, resulting in an increase in low-level rainwater content and, correspondingly, an increase in ground precipitation. When the water vapor conditions are insufficient, the dispersion of AgI does not trigger effective precipitation, consistent with the results of station observations and actual flight evaluations. This study provides an effective method for scientifically evaluating the potential and effectiveness of aircraft cloud seeding operations.

**Source Name**: Increase of precipitation by cloud seeding observed from a case study in November 2020 over Shijiazhuang, China (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169809521003227)
**Abstract**:
Human weather modification is a method to influence cloud developing process so that the precipitation becomes more beneficial to local human society. A long existing challenging issue is the quantification of the efficiency of cloud seeding. This study investigates the changes of cloud and precipitation properties after cloud seeding by using the observations from a comprehensive experiment carried out over Shijiazhuang, China on November 21, 2020. The precipitation events before the cloud seeding experiment make the atmospheric background with sufficient water vapor. Comparison of the cloud and precipitation properties between before and after the cloud seeding shows distinct changes in both cloud and precipitation properties based on observations from ground sites, aircraft, and satellite. The aircraft observations show that the [cloud droplet](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/cloud-droplet "Learn more about cloud droplet from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") number concentration and liquid water content decreased significantly, and the ice particle concentration and precipitation particle concentration increased significantly, after cloud seeding. The [satellite remote sensing](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/satellite-remote-sensing "Learn more about satellite remote sensing from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") observations show a semi-circle with decreased cloud reflection in visible channel after cloud seeding. The ground [weather radar](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/meteorological-radar "Learn more about weather radar from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") shows increased radar reflectivity echos for clouds impacted by seeding, indicating the formation of precipitation. After cloud seeding, there are also two short-term precipitation events occurring in the periods of 04:54–04:56 and 05:26–05:34 UTC over ZhaoXian, and 05:05–05:14 and 06:13–06:22 UTC over NingJin on November 21, 2020, with total precipitation amount of 0.04 mm and 0.042 mm, respectively. All the research findings show robust evidences of conversion from liquid droplets to ice particles and increased precipitation by the cloud seeding during this experiment.
