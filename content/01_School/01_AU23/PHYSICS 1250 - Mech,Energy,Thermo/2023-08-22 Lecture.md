# Topics:
- [[Linear Kinematics]]
	- description of motion
		- frame of reference (what point you are measuring from)
			- need the 0th position
			- need the positive direction
		- system of units
			- SI Base Units
				- meters(distance)
				- kg (mass)
				- seconds (time)
				- amperes (electric current)
<-y--0----------x--->

x = 20cm = 2m
y = -10cm

distance = how far away you are from reference point (scaler)
displacement = vector
speed
velocity = $\frac{displacement}{time}$
average velocity = $\bar{v}= \frac{x(t_2)-x(t_1)}{t_2-t_1}$
acceleration = rate of change of velocity
instantaneous velocity v then,
$a = \frac{v(t_2)-v(t_1)}{t_2-t_1}$

position -> velocity -> acceleration

consider $a$ constant
$a = \frac{v(t_2)-v(t_1)}{\Delta t}$ 

v at t = 0 is $v_0$

$v = v_0 + at$ 
want x(t)

$\bar v = \frac{x(t) - x_0}{t}$
