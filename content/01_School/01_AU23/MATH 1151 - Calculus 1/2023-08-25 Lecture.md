### Exponential and Logarithmic Functions

Exponential function - one of the form $f(x)=b^x$, where b $\ne$ 1 is a positive real number
	Domain: all reals

Logarithmic function - log base b of x = y --> $b^y = x$ 
	Domain: $(0, \infty)$, *range of $b^x$ (inverses)*

Exponential and Logarithm are **inverses**

log base 2 of 1024 = 2^x = 1024
x = 10

### What Is A Limit

Intuitively, the limit of f(x) as x approaches a is L, written lim x->oo f(x) = L

#### Floor:
going down until you hit an integer, denoted by [x]
Examples:
$[\pi]=3$
$[2.5]=2$ 
$[10]=10$
$[-1.1]=2$
