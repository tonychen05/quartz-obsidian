### @Override
The `@Override` annotation is a standard **Java** annotation and denotes that the child class method overrides the base class method.

For two reasons, the `@Override` annotation is useful:
1. If the annotated method does not actually override anything, the compiler issues a warning.
2. It can help to make the source code more readable.
