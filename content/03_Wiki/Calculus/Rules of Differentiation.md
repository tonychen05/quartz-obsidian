> [!INFO] Notations for Derivative
> $$ f'(x)=\frac{d}{dx}f(x) $$
> $$\dot{f}(x)$$
> $$\frac{df}{dx}(x)$$
> $$f^(1)(x)$$
> The value of the derivative  at $x=a$ can also be written as $$f'(c)=\left[ \frac{d}{dx}f(x) \right]_{x=a}=\frac{d}{dx}f(x)|_{x=a}$$

> [!NOTE] Constant Rule
> The derivative of a **constant** is 0

> [!NOTE] Power Rule
> For any real number $n$, $\frac{d}{dx}x^{n}=n\cdot x^{n-1}$

> [!NOTE] Sum Rule
> If $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are differentiable and $c$ is a constant, then
> a) $\frac{d}{dx}(f(x)+g(x))=f'(x)+g'(x)$
> b) $\frac{d}{dx}(f(x)-g(x))=f'(x)-g'(x)$
> c) $\frac{d}{dx}(c\cdot f(x))=c\cdot f'(x)$

> [!NOTE] Derivative of $e^x$
> $$\frac{d}{dx}e^x=e^x$$

> [!NOTE] Derivative of sine
> $$\frac{d}{d\theta}\sin \theta=\cos \theta$$

> [!NOTE] Derivative of cosine
> $$\frac{d}{d\theta}\cos \theta=-\sin \theta$$
