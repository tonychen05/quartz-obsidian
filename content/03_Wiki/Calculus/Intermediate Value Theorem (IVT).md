> [!INFO] Definition: IVT
> If $f$ is a continuous function for all $x$ ***closed*** interval $[a,b]$ is between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$, then there is a number $e$ in $(a,b)$ such that $f(c)=d$

> [!EXAMPLE]
> ![[Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT).png]]

> [!NOTE]
> Does not necessarily have to pass horizontal line test

> [!TIP] Bisection Method
> The bisection method isÂ **an approximation method to find the roots of the given equation by repeatedly dividing the interval**. This method will divide the interval until the resulting interval is found, which is extremely small.
> 
> For example, if the interval is $[-10,10]$, check $[-5,10]$ and so on...
