> [!EXAMPLE] Graph of a Rational Function
> ![[Rational Functions.png]]
> The graphs of rational functions can take on many different shapes. Their graphs often have vertical, horizontal, or slant asymptotes.

> [!INFO] Rational Function Formula
> Rational functions have the form $$
f(x)=\frac{p(x)}{q(x)},$$ where $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ are polynomials. 

> [!INFO] Domain and Range
> The domain of a rational function is all real numbers except those x values which make the denominator equal zero.
