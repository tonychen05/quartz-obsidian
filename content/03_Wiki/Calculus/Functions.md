# Identifying a Function
- A function must pass the **vertical line test**, that is *every input must only have a single output*

## Domain and Range
### Domain:
the domain of a function is the set of all input values, or x values, for which a function is defined
### Range:
the range of a function is the set of all output values, or y values
