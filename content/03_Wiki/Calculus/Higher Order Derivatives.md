> [!INFO] Increasing or Decreasing
> A function is **increasing** on any interval $I$ where $f'(x)>0$, for all $x\in I$
> 
> A function is **decreasing** on any interval $I$ where $f'(x)<0$, for all $x\in I$

> [!NOTE] Notation
> We call the derivative of the derivative the second derivative. Derivative of the second derivative is the third derivative, and so on.
> 
> First derivative: $\frac{d}{dx}f(x)=f'(x)=f^{(1)}x$
> Second derivative: $\frac{d^2}{dx^2}f(x)=f''(x)=f^{(2)}x$
> Third derivative: $\frac{d^3}{dx^3}f(x)=f'''(x)=f^{(3)}x$

> [!INFO] Concavity
> Let $f$ be a function differentiable on an open interval $I$.
> - $f$ is concave **up** on $I$ if $f'$ is increasing on $I$
> - $f$ is concave **down** on $I$ if $f'$ is decreasing on $I$
