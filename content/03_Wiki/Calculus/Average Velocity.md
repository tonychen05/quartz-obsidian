> [!INFO] Definition: Average Velocity
> The average velocity on the time interval $[a,b]$ is given by $$ v_{av}=\frac{\text{change in position}}{\text{change in time}} = \frac{s(b)-s(a)}{b-a}=\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}} = \text{slope of secant line}$$
> where $s(t)$ denotes the position, at the time $t$, of an object moving along a line
