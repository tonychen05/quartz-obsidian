> [!INFO] Definition: Derivative
> The derivative of $f$ at $a$, denoted $f'(a)$, is given by $$f'(a)=\lim_{ x \to a }\frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a},$$
> provided the limit exists, and is therefore the instantaneous rate of change. We say hat $f$ is differentiable at $a$ if this limit exists. Otherwise, we say $f$ is non-differentiable

> [!INFO] Other Definition:
> $$
f'(x)=\lim_{ h \to 0 } \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}
$$

Allows to more precisely define the [[Tangent Line|tangent line]] at a point

> [!NOTE] Differentiability Implies Continuity
> If $f$ is a **differentiable** function at $x=a$, then $f$ is **continuous** at $x=a$.
> 
> In the same way, non-differntiability implies non-continuity
