> [!INFO] Standard Form of Quadratic
The standard form of a quadratic function is $$
f(x)=ax^2+bx+c
$$ with $a\ne0.$ If $a>0$, the parabola opens *up* and if $a<0$, the parabola opens *down*

> [!NOTE] Alternative Formula
> Some quadratic functions can be factored and written in the form $$
f(x)=a(x-x_{1})(x-x_{2}),$$
where $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the x-intercepts (or roots) of the function

> [!INFO] Domain and Range
> **Domain:** $(-\infty,\infty)$
> **Range:** The range of a quadratic is not all reals; the function has either a maximum or minimum which occurs at the vertex.
