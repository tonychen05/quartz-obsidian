> [!INFO] Definition: Tangent Line
> Let $f$ be a function differentiable at $a$. The **line tangent to the curve** $y=f(x)$ at the point $(a,f(a))$ is the line that passes through the point $(a,f(a))$ whose slope is equal to $f(a)$.
> 
> Thus, using point-slope form, the equation of the tangent line is $$y-y_{0}=m(x-x_{0})$$

> [!WARNING]
> Leave in point-slope form unless told otherwise
