> [!INFO] Continuity of Famous Functions
> The following functions are continuous on their natural domains:
> - constants ($f(x)=3$)
> - [[Continuity of Polynomial Functions|polynomials]]
> - [[Continuity of Rational Functions|rational]]
> - power
> - exponential
> - logarithmic
> - trigonometric
> - inverse trig

>That is, **they are continuous wherever they are defined**
