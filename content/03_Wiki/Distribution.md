> [!INFO] Define: Distribution
> The set of phonetic environments in which a phone occurs
> - **Phonetic environment**: sounds that come before and after it in a word
# Types of Distribution:
- Contrastive (change in sound = change in meaning)
- Complementary (mutually exclusive)
	- `<epic>` vs. `<cat>`
	- may be an indication that they are allophones of the same phoneme
- Free Variation (overlapping; no change in meaning)
