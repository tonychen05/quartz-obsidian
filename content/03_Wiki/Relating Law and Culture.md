The word "law" comes from a variety of Latin and Nordic words meaning "to bind" (people together). People who are "bound together" share a common culture, and all cultures share certain core elements.

> [!NOTE] Recall: Culture
> The totality of learned socially transmitted behaviors, ideas, values, customs, artifacts, and technology of groups of people living in a common society.

All cultures possess six primary elements: beliefs, values, norms, symbols, technology, and language

# Beliefs

> [!INFO] Definition: Beliefs
> The ideas that we have about how the world operates and what is true and false

Laws are often enacted to support our most deeply held beliefs, and as beliefs change over time, so do the laws that support them.

For example, laws of heresy against those who believed the sun was at the center out of solar system and slavery "property rights"

# Values

> [!INFO] Definition: Values
> Normative standards shared by the culture about what is good and bad, correct and incorrect, moral and immoral, normal and deviant

American values are based on transplanted and modified Western European values. Examples of broad and general “core” values in all Western societies include the Golden Rule, justice, equality, liberty, and the sanctity of life. Even though everyone defines these core values as good, people of different ideological persuasions may have quite different images in their heads when they talk about them.

# Norms
> [!INFO] Definition: Norm
> The action component of a value or a belief patterning social behavior in ways consistent with those values and beliefs

Laws always reflect the core values and mores of a culture. Western core values typically come from its Jewish/Christian heritage (think of the Ten Commandments and the criminal law: “Thou shalt not kill”, “Thou shalt not steal”, etc.). Few laws are ever passed that contravene deeply held cultural values without significant opposition from large segments of society. Laws assuring abortion rights, for instance, are so hotly debated because they involve conflicting core values: the sanctity of human life versus a woman’s privacy and liberty to choose what happens to her body.

Legal philosophers distinguish between **positive law** and **natural law**. **Positive law** is derived from the norms and customs of specific cultures, focusing on how law functions within its cultural context without moral evaluation. **Legal positivism** examines law as it is, emphasizing its authority and coerciveness over its moral content. Positivists assert that law and morality are interconnected but separate; law is valid if it has appropriate authority, regardless of its moral implications.

In contrast, **natural law** theory argues for universal moral standards that should govern and limit positive law. Natural law proponents criticize relativism, which they believe undermines objective criteria for judging laws and moral practices. They argue that without universal principles, laws could justify harmful practices, as there would be no basis for critiquing such practices beyond cultural tolerance. Despite being a positivist, H.L.A. Hart acknowledged that incorporating moral principles into the legal system, as seen in the U.S. Constitution, can align with positivist views while still addressing moral considerations.

# Symbols
> [!INFO] Definition: Symbols
> Concrete physical signs that “stand for” and signify abstractions that range from the mundane and specific, such as the little man or woman painted on the restroom door, to those that are suffused with meaning and can evoke the deepest of feelings, such as a nation’s flag

Anthropologists and sociologists use the term **symbolic culture** to describe nonmaterial aspects of culture, focusing here on tangible symbols that represent abstract concepts. Symbols can range from simple signs, like restroom figures, to profound ones, like national flags, which evoke deep emotional responses. For example, the American flag can stir vastly different feelings depending on the viewer's cultural context, such as in Washington, Paris, or Tehran.

Symbols play a crucial role in the law, an inherently abstract concept. In a courtroom, the use of symbols—like robed judges, official oaths, and national flags—serves to underscore the law's significance and authority. The law must represent values that resonate with society to be considered legitimate.

One prominent symbol of justice is **Themis** (or **Justitia**), the Greek goddess of justice. She is often depicted with scales for measuring fairness and a sword for enforcing legal rulings, and her blindfold symbolizes impartiality. This imagery helps convey the majesty and power of the law, reinforcing its legitimacy and importance.

# Technology
> [!INFO] Definition: Technology
> Totality of the knowledge and techniques a people employ to create the material objects of their sustenance and comfort

**Technology** encompasses the knowledge and methods used by societies to produce the material goods necessary for their survival and comfort. As Karl Marx noted, different technological stages (e.g., hunting and gathering, agriculture, industrial, postindustrial) shape a culture's physical, social, and psychological environments. Technological advancements significantly influence daily life, including beliefs, values, and symbolic interpretations.

Technology impacts the law in several ways:
1. **New Tools:** Innovations like fingerprinting and DNA testing alter criminal investigations and legal processes.
2. **Media Advances:** Technologies such as TV and social media affect public perception and the execution of legal processes.
3. **Emerging Issues:** New technologies introduce complex legal questions, like those related to reproductive technologies, internet issues, and genetic engineering.

Modern technological risks, like nuclear accidents and chemical spills, differ from past external catastrophes because they are often human-made and have global consequences. This shift has led to a "risk society," where managing and mitigating risks becomes central. While risks might not be greater than before, our awareness and control efforts have increased. Legal systems, whether local, national, or international, must adapt to address these evolving challenges and manage risks effectively.

# Language

> [!INFO] Definition: Language
> Language is a vast repository of information about culture; it is in effect the “storehouse of culture.”

**Language** serves as the fundamental repository of culture and is essential for the development of any complex society. It allows humans to communicate abstract ideas, discuss the past, and plan for the future, setting us apart from other species. While animals communicate, only humans use language to express and understand abstract concepts.

**Social Media and Law Enforcement:**

- **Use of Social Media:** Law enforcement increasingly utilizes social media for various purposes, including monitoring known or suspected criminals, tracking online activities, and gathering intelligence. This involves watching specific individuals or groups, using informants, or employing analytical software to process and analyze data.
  
- **Cases and Controversies:** For example, during the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests in Los Angeles, law enforcement used social media data provided by a private firm. This practice has raised concerns, particularly when monitoring is inconsistent or politically biased. Social media is also used to address issues such as cyberstalking and missing persons.

- **Legal and Ethical Issues:** The use of social media by police raises legal and ethical questions, including concerns about free speech, privacy, and due process rights. New challenges will emerge as social media continues to evolve as a tool for law enforcement.

**Language and Law:**
Words derive their meanings from cultural definitions, and in literate societies, writing allows this cultural knowledge to be recorded and passed down through generations. Language thus facilitates cultural evolution and helps shape the reality of a culture's members.

Language is crucial for law because it enables the clear formulation, communication, and understanding of rules and regulations. Without written language, legal systems would lack the precision needed to define and enforce conduct. As societies become more complex, they increasingly depend on written laws to regulate behavior, establish authority, and outline social responsibilities. Law, deeply embedded in culture, has been a fundamental aspect of human societies, leading to extensive scholarly debate on its nature and function.
