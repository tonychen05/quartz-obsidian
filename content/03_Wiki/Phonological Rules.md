# Format
- Rules can be written in the form X→Y / C_D, where C_D represents the conditioning environment.
- Example: **/t/→[ɾ] / stressed vowel _ unstressed vowel**
	- meaning /t/ is pronounced as [ɾ] between a stressed and an unstressed vowel.

# Types of Phonological Rules
- Assimilation
	- **Definition:** Assimilation occurs when a sound becomes more like a neighboring sound in terms of a particular phonetic property.
	- **Example:** 
		- In English, nasal place assimilation is common. For instance, in the word "unbelievable," the nasal /n/ changes its place of articulation to match the following bilabial sound, and it is pronounced as [m].
		- hae**nd**bag -> hae**m**bag
- Dissimilation
	- **Definition:** Dissimilation involves making two adjacent or close sounds less similar with respect to a certain phonetic property.
	- **Example:** 
		- In Modern Greek, there is manner dissimilation. A stop becomes a fricative when followed by another stop. For instance, /epta/ 'seven' can be pronounced as [efta].
		- (surprise) serprise -> suprise 
- Insertion
	- **Definition:** Insertion rules add a segment to the phonetic form that is not present at the phonemic level.
	- **Example:**
		- In English, voiceless stop insertion can occur between a nasal consonant and a voiceless fricative. For example, "dance" /dæns/ can be pronounced as [dænts].
		- (something) samthin -> sampthing
- Deletion
	- **Definition:** Deletion rules eliminate a sound from the phonetic form that was present at the phonemic level.
	- **Example:** 
		- In English, /h/-deletion is common, especially in unstressed syllables. For instance, in the phrase "He handed her his hat," the /h/ sound in unstressed syllables may be deleted, resulting in [hi hændaed ɹ̩z hæt].
		- (family) family -> famly
- Strengthening
	- **Definition:** Strengthening (fortition) rules make sounds stronger.
	- **Example:** 
		- In English, the aspiration rule is a type of strengthening. Voiceless stops become aspirated when they occur at the beginning of a stressed syllable. For instance, "pat" [pʰæt] and "top" [tʰɑp].
- Weakening
	- **Definition:** Weakening (lenition) rules cause sounds to become weaker.
	- **Example:** 
		- In American English, flapping is a weakening rule. An alveolar stop is realized as [ɾ] when it occurs after a stressed vowel and before an unstressed vowel. For example, "butter" [ˈbʌtər] can be pronounced as [ˈbʌɾər].
- Metathesis
	- **Definition:** Metathesis involves changing the order of sounds.
	- **Example:** In Leti, an Austronesian language, there is CV metathesis when three consecutive consonants occur. For example, /danat + kviali/ 'millipede' becomes [dantakviali].
