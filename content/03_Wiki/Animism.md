# Animistic Beliefs of the Ainu in Japan

> [!NOTE] The Ainu
> The Ainu people are the indigenous people of Japan and until the early 20th century led a hunting, gathering, and horticultural lifestyle. Most Ainu today live on Japan’s northern island of Hokkaido.

Spirits are thought to reside in all living things, as well as in rocks, mountains, waterfalls, and other “inanimate” phenomena of the natural world. Certain powerful spirits are regarded as divinities called _kamui_ (similar to the _kami_ in Japanese Shinto beliefs, but with some differences). 

One important idea is the inter-relationship between the world of spirits and the world of humans. Animals are thought to be _kamui_ in disguise. They come to the human world in animal form (_hayokpe_) and are considered a gift of meat and hides. Hunters kill animals with this understanding in mind. Thus, when a deer or bear is killed, feasts are held to celebrate the gifts. A special seat is left vacant for the spirit to sit in and songs and dances are sung in its honor. 

Specially trimmed sticks (called _inau_) are also presented to the spirits as gifts to take back to the spirit world. It is hoped that the _kamui_ divinities will make a good report and encourage other spirits to bring more meat and hides to the humans. Thus, a balance between humans and spirits of the natural world was maintained for centuries before natural resources began to be over-harvested in the late 19th century as a result of population inflow and the needs of an industrializing country.

Belief in *kashin* (house spirits)

Other spirits populate the home as well. These include the courtyard spirit, the doorway spirit, the pickled vegetable crock spirits, the kitchen spirit, the well spirit, and even a toilet spirit (said to be quite ugly). Tiny pictures or images, including constellations of stars associated with a particular spirit, are sometimes placed near the objects where the spirits reside. In some homes, incense is regularly burned to gain favor of the spirits.
