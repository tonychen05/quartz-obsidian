The contact of two or more distinct languages

# Borrowing
- Two types:
	- **Lexical borrowing**: borrowing words and phrases
	- **Structural borrowing**: borrowing phonology, morphology, syntactic patterns
- Certain things are not normally borrowed:
	- "core" vocabulary: body parts, familial relations, environmental entities
	- Grammatical function words: the, my, etc.

> [!INFO] Define: adstratum
> An adstratum (plural: adstrata) or adstrate isÂ **a language that influences another language by virtue of geographic proximity, not by virtue of its relative prestige**.

# Outcomes
- **Language convergence**: when two languages become more similar
	- Sprachbund: a region of language convergence
	- Examples: India, Balkan Peninsula
- **Language shift**: after long, intense contact of unequal prestige, a group of speakers abandon their native language
	- Prestige of speakers affects linguistic systems; adstratal relationships occur when speakers are equally prestigious, while **Semantics** (less prestigious language)/**superstratum** (more prestigious language) relationships occur when there's an imbalance in prestige.
- Creation of Languages such as [[Pidgin]] and [[Creole]]
