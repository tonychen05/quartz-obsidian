The **for loop** is used to **repeat** a section of code known number of times. Or, a for loop is used for **iterating** over a [[sequence]] (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string)

# Syntax:

## Java
```java
int i;
for ( i = 0; i < 3; ++i) { 
	System.out.format("i: %d%n", i);
}

/*
Output:
i: 0
1: 1
i: 2
*/
```

## MatLab
```matlab
for i = 1:5:10
	i
end

% Output:
% i = 1
% i = 6
```
