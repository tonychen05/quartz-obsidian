The study of how context affects language use.
## Context: 
The surroundings which affect the meaning of the utterance

#### Sentences and Utterances: 
- Whenever a sentence is used (signed or spoken), there has been an utterance of the sentence. 
- Not an abstraction. It is an event, something that happens. 
- Read the sentence: There is a platypus in the bathtub out loud. Now, ask the next person you see to do the same thing. If you have followed these instructions, then you have just heard two utterances, but there is only one sentence.

**Types of Context**:
- Linguistic
	- what preceded an utterance in a discourse (conversation)
- Situational
	- information about the situation in which it is uttered
- Social
	- the relationship between people speaking and what their roles are
