# What is law?

Trying to define "law" is a challenging task and there have been many definitions over the years.

For the purpose of providing a general definition:

> [!INFO] Definition: Law
> **Law** is a written body of general rules of conduct applicable to all members of a defined community, society, or culture, which **emanate from a governing authority** and which are **enforced by its agents** through the imposition of penalties for their violation.

This definition would not be acceptable to everyone but it is appropriate for modern systems of law. Issues arise when describing preliterate societies because by definition, they do not possess writing, nor do they typically employ agents to enforce rules of conduct.

The word "law" comes from a variety of Latin and Nordic words meaning "to bind" (people together). People who are "bound together" share a common culture, and all cultures share certain core elements.

# Historical Development of Law
The Western legal tradition may be traced to the [[Code of Hammurabi]]. This is the first known written legal code, and it expressed a retributivist “eye for an eye” philosophy. 

Roman law, the next major codified set of legal principles, was influenced heavily by Babylonian legal principles in the Code of Hammurabi. The Roman Laws of the Twelve Tables (450 bce) was the first entirely secular written legal code (the Code of Hammurabi was very much a religious as well as secular code). During this time, law began to change its focus from acting as a mechanism for resolving private disputes to viewing crimes as offenses against society as well as against the victim.

## Common Law
The Roman Empire's expansion brought Roman law to Western Europe, which influenced the development of England's legal system after the Norman Conquest of 1066. The Normans introduced feudal law, which evolved into the **common law** system, a more unified body of law. By Henry II's reign (1154–1189), and known as the "father of the common law," a national body of law had formed, and legal decisions were documented and circulated. The *Treatise on the Laws and Customs of the Realm of England* (1188) by Ranulf de Glanvill marked a shift towards formal legal rules, creating a unified common law.

The Magna Carta of 1215, drafted by English barons to limit King John's power, was the next important document in the evolution of common law and introduced early concepts of rights like **trial by jury** and **proportional punishment**, though it initially benefited only the nobility, and **privilege against self-incrimination**. 

Henry de Bracton’s *On the Laws and Customs of England* (1250–1260) expanded on this foundation, emphasizing that common law was based on case law and ancient customs, not imposed codes. This period saw the emergence of stare decisis and precedent, where judges began to rely on previous rulings to guide future decisions, solidifying the common law as judge-made law.

# Precedent and Stare Decisis
Under the English common law system, each final court decision creates a **precedent** that binds the court that issued it and all lower courts. This system, brought to America by early colonists, remains in place today, with state courts bound by their state's highest court and federal courts by the U.S. Supreme Court. Precedent is binding only within the issuing court's jurisdiction, but decisions from other jurisdictions can be persuasive.

**Stare decisis**, meaning "let the decision stand," is the principle that courts should follow prior rulings in similar cases, providing predictability in the legal system. However, not all court statements set precedent; only the *ratio decidendi* (the reason for the decision) does, while supporting statements (*obiter dicta*) do not.

Precedents can be overruled by higher courts or legislative action if permitted by the constitution. Courts may also distinguish cases to avoid overruling a precedent, keeping the legal principles intact while addressing new facts differently.

William Blackstone, an English judge and philosopher, greatly influenced common law and American legal thought. His *Commentaries on the Laws of England* (1765–1769) systematized common law into four parts: individual rights, public wrongs, private wrongs, and property rights. His work profoundly shaped the Founding Fathers and the principles in the Declaration of Independence, with his influence second only to the Bible in American history.

# Sources of Law
There are several primary sources of law, including judge-made law (common law) and legislative law, which comprises the Constitution, statutes, ordinances, and administrative regulations. The U.S. Constitution is the supreme legal authority, overriding any conflicting statutes. **Legislatures**, under constitutional authority, enact statutes that are collected into codes. However, not all legislative acts are lawful; they must align with the Constitution. The U.S. Supreme Court has the final authority to determine the constitutionality of statutes, a power known as judicial review.

**Administrative regulations**, created by executive agencies or independent agencies through delegated authority, can have the force of law and are enforced by courts like statutes. These regulations often fill in details left ambiguous by broadly written statutes. Ambiguities in statutes arise from the complexities of human behavior and the compromises inherent in the legislative process. As a result, courts often interpret and clarify the terms of statutes. In some states, judges, who may be elected, can face removal if their interpretations are unpopular with the electorate.
