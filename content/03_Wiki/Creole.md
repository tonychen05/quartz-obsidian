Language developed form contact between speakers of different langauges and that serves as the primary means of communication for a particular group of speakers

Two most common social contexts for creole origins:
1) Plantation settings
2) Slavery settings

May develop from a [[pidgin]] (nativation)

### Difference from Pidgin
- different social context
- still highly reduced grammar and lexicon
- limited morphology, more complex syntactic structures
- **creoles have first language speakers**
