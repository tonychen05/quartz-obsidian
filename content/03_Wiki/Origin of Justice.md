Consider the first moral statement children make: "That's not fair!!"

How do children arrive at that conclusion so readily and why is it so immediately compelling if the sense of fairness is not somehow within them?

Finkel, Harré, and Rodriguez Lopez (2001) call these “not fair” complaints “**commonsense justice**” because they “are uttered long before children come into contact with any formal introduction to general moral principles” (p. 7).

If there is a natural law: Is it the product of God concerned with our well-being or the product of blind evolutionary processes. 

The concept of law as an instinct for rule-making that is as natural to the human species as thought and emotion. Proponents of natural law believe in a natural basis for law based on an inner voice yearning for justice, although they differ on its source. 

One perspective is the **transcendental perspective**, and the other is the **evolutionary perspective**. The first words of the Declaration of Independence shows that the Framers hedged their bets by making reference to both the transcendental and natural perspectives of natural law:

## Transcendental Natural Law Perspective

Moral relativists believe that moral standards are shaped by specific cultures, meaning practices that may seem morally wrong to outsiders (e.g., cannibalism or clitorectomy) could be accepted as morally right within those societies. 

Transcendentalists, on the other hand, argue that there are universal, timeless moral laws that transcend specific cultures and times, based on a higher spiritual or divine realm.

> philosophical position that emphasizes the primacy and superiority of the spiritual over the material

These natural laws, often considered God-given, are reflected in concepts like the Ten Commandments and the US Declaration of Independence, which speaks of inalienable rights endowed by a Creator. 

Natural law operates as an unwritten moral guide that tempers positive law (written law) with fairness and justice. It has been used to limit state power, justify revolutions like the American Revolution, and advocate for human dignity and rights. 

Natural law may be considered “law within the law”, a set of moral precepts that tempers positivist law with concerns of fairness and justice that are absolutist principles morally binding on all societies and individuals. The international legal community even has a name for something quite close to this called jus cogens, which literally means “compelling” or “higher” law. Although this principle does not explicitly appeal to natural law, it obviously is strongly influenced by it and has been an accepted doctrine in international law since 1986.

Despite its divine origins for some, natural law does not require belief in God—secular proponents argue it is derived from human nature and demands that people be treated with dignity, in line with principles like the Golden Rule. However, the interpretation of natural law has historically been contested, sometimes supporting tyrannical rule (e.g., the divine right of kings), while at other times promoting justice and limiting power.

## Evolutionary Perspective
The evolutionary perspective on law and justice links these concepts to principles of evolutionary biology. It posits that law is "natural" because it emerges from the evolved nature of Homo sapiens. 

According to this view, the ability to create and understand rules likely had a significant impact on human evolution by promoting survival and reproductive success. Unlike the transcendental view, which sees natural law as originating from a higher realm, the evolutionary perspective starts with human biology and behavior, proposing that norms and laws arose from choices that favored survival and reproduction.

Evolutionary theorists argue that our moral sensibilities and the rules we call law are products of evolved traits. These traits, including a sense of moral outrage and the desire for justice, likely developed as counterstrategies to exploitative behaviors. This perspective suggests that moral outrage, which underpins the desire for punishment and justice, has a biological basis that was advantageous for ancestral humans. This basis is reflected in how our brains respond to punishment and how "altruistic punishment" (punishment by individuals who have not been personally wronged) promotes cooperation.

The evolutionary view does not equate "natural" with "good" or "desirable" but focuses on understanding law as a by-product of our evolved desires for fairness and order. It emphasizes that while moral universality exists, specific cultural norms and responses to injustice can vary widely. This approach acknowledges that while laws are culturally constructed, they are motivated by innate human drives.
