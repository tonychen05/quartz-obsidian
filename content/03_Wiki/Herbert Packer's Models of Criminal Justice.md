Herbert Packer's seminal article on the two models of criminal justice—the **crime control model** and the **due process model**—has significantly influenced how we understand the balance between public safety and individual rights within the criminal justice system. 

### Crime Control Model
The **crime control model** emphasizes:

- **Efficiency**: The need for a swift and efficient criminal justice system to ensure public safety.
- **Finality**: The importance of quickly resolving cases and minimizing appeals to maintain societal order.
- **Community Protection**: The primary goal is to suppress criminal activity to protect the community.
- **Informal Procedures**: The system is streamlined, with less emphasis on procedural formalities.

The crime control model aligns with traditional conservative values, focusing on ensuring that justice is served through prompt and decisive action. Critics argue that it can lead to a disregard for individual rights and procedural safeguards.

### Due Process Model
The **due process model** emphasizes:

- **Legal Formality**: The importance of adhering to procedural safeguards to ensure fairness.
- **Rights of the Accused**: The necessity for the accused to have access to a fair trial, including rights such as being informed of charges, having legal counsel, and confronting accusers.
- **Integrity of the Process**: Ensuring that all procedures are followed correctly, even if it means that some guilty individuals might escape conviction.
- **Obstacles to Efficiency**: The due process model may result in longer trials and more appeals, reflecting its focus on legal correctness over efficiency.

This model aligns with traditional liberal values, prioritizing the protection of individual rights and the integrity of the legal process. However, it may be criticized for potentially allowing some guilty individuals to evade justice due to procedural technicalities.

### Examples and Implications
The cases of **Brewer v. Williams (1977)** and **Nix v. Williams (1984)** illustrate the tension between these models:

- **Brewer v. Williams**: The Supreme Court ruled that evidence obtained through a violation of the accused’s right to counsel (a confession following a "Christian burial speech") was inadmissible. This decision reflects the due process model's focus on procedural fairness but led to criticism for potentially ignoring the practical implications of justice for the victim’s family.

- **Nix v. Williams**: In this case, the Court created an exception to the exclusionary rule, known as the "inevitable discovery" doctrine, allowing the admission of evidence that would have been discovered eventually by lawful means. This decision attempted to reconcile the need for procedural fairness with the practical need for justice, illustrating a balancing act between the two models.

### Balancing the Models
Both models have their strengths and weaknesses. The crime control model emphasizes community safety but risks compromising individual rights, while the due process model upholds procedural fairness but can sometimes hinder the efficient administration of justice. In practice, most legal systems operate somewhere along a continuum between these extremes, aiming to balance efficiency and rights protection.

### Conclusion
Packer’s models highlight the fundamental tension in criminal justice between ensuring public safety and protecting individual rights. The challenge lies in finding a balanced approach that maintains both effective law enforcement and respect for legal principles. As seen in the evolving legal landscape, the continual "tinkering" and adjustments between these models reflect an ongoing effort to achieve this balance in the pursuit of justice.
