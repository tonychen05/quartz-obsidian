# Keywords

> [!INFO] Definition: Culture
> **Culture** is the complex total of all the many, varied, and layered levels of learning and knowledge of a group of people and their behavior. This basic definition of culture includes behaviors that range from the basics of language and toolmaking to cultural productions like art and literature, that is, the humanities.
> - learned stuff
> - culture is shared, but individuals interpret the norms
> - thus, the idea of *central tendencies* that become *points of reference* is useful in describing a particular group's culture deemed ***traditions*** 


> [!INFO] Definition: Traditions
> Culture-specific materials, assumptions, options, etc. that bear upon individual behavior and are passed on by the culture
> - Traditions change over time: they are *dynamic* not static; a *process* of change and continuity


> [!INFO] Definition: Context
> **Context** is the situation in which something occurs. It includes the totality of physical place, material objects, language, actions, and participants. The next time it occurs, conditions may be somewhat different. If a tea ritual is held in a very private and expensive “traditional” tea garden, the meanings are certainly somewhat different from those evoked in a tea ritual held in a department store in downtown Tokyo. Yet both are part of the general tradition of the Japanese tea ritual.

# Cultural Continuities

> [!ABSTRACT] Overview
> - East Asian cultures have a long history of interaction with periods of positive relations, cultural borrowing, and mutual influence, but also times of minimal interaction and war.
> - Despite differences, certain bedrock attributes tie East Asian cultures together, including premodern technology, agricultural practices, traditional worldview influenced by Confucianism, Daoism, Buddhism, and nature-based beliefs, stress on family and hierarchy, values of education and self-cultivation, and common historical experiences.

**Early Technology and Material Culture:**
- Advanced ceramic technology, bronze casting, architectural patterns, and paper invention originated in East Asia and played a role in international trade.
- Innovations in cloth production, including silk, hemp, and cotton, as well as certain dyes, were widespread in the region.
- High-quality porcelain and ceramics from East Asia attracted Europeans in the 16th century.

**Agriculture:**
- Wet-rice agriculture, sericulture, and tea culture began early and spread in the region.
- Rice agriculture, dating back to 5,000 BCE in China, emphasizes group cooperation and remains important for national identity.

**Chinese-Influenced Writing Systems:**
- Writing originated in China around 1800 BCE and was adopted and adapted by Koreans and Japanese, leading to the creation of their own writing systems.

**Self-Cultivation, Education, and Hard Work:**
- East Asian cultures value self-cultivation, education, and hard work, influenced in part by Confucianism.
- The emphasis on education and hard work is considered a factor in East Asia's economic competitiveness.

**Neoconfucian Heritage:**
- Shared tendencies across China, Korea, and Japan include strong affiliation with groups, respect for social hierarchies, and context-sensitive behavior.
- Concepts like "face" and the dichotomy between tatemae (surface) and honne (inner self) are common, influenced by Confucianism and intensive agriculture legacies.

**Elements of World-View:**
- Confucianism, Daoism, nature-based beliefs, Buddhism, and other systems contribute to East Asian worldviews.
- Differing beliefs often coexist peacefully, and interactions with Western cultures, new technologies, and globalization have shaped worldviews in the last two centuries.
