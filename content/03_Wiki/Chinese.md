### Introduction:
- East Asia's languages are diverse and belong to two major families: Sino-Tibetan and Ural-Altaic.
- Chinese, Korean, and Japanese have complex linguistic relationships, including borrowing writing systems and words.

### The Spoken Languages in East Asia:
#### Chinese Spoken Language:
- **Variety**: Chinese consists of various topolects spoken by the Han ethnic group across China, Taiwan, and Chinese communities worldwide.
- **Topolect Regions**: Major regions include Mandarin, Cantonese, Xiang, Wu, Min, Gan, and Hakka.
- **Standardization**: Standard Chinese, based on Beijing dialect, is adopted as a national standard, known as Putonghua in China and Guoyu in Taiwan.
- **Media and Usage**: Standard Chinese is widely used in media, education, and official settings, though regional languages persist in some areas like Hong Kong.
- **Tones**: Chinese uses tones to differentiate meanings, with varying numbers of tones across dialects.
- **Verbals**: Aspect in Chinese is determined by context and particles rather than verb endings.
- **Spoken Question Particles**: Questions are marked by particles, such as "ma," rather than changes in word order or pitch.
- **Sentence Order**: Chinese sentences follow the SVO pattern, unlike SOV languages like Korean and Japanese.
- **Non-gender Specific Pronouns**: Chinese lacks gender-specific pronouns, with "ta" used for he/she/it depending on context.
- **Plurals and Classifiers**: Chinese uses measure words instead of adding plurals, with classifiers denoting specific measurements or characteristics.

### The Written Languages in East Asia:

#### The Chinese Writing System:
- **History**: Dates back to at least the Shang dynasty, possibly earlier. Adopted by Koreans and Japanese, leading to mixed systems.
- **Character Composition**: Characters composed of radicals (bushou) with approximately 214 parts. No alphabet, requiring memorization of characters.
- **Simplified and Traditional Characters**: Mainland China uses simplified characters, Taiwan (and Hong Kong) uses traditional characters.
- **Character Interpretation**: Some characters offer clues to meaning or pronunciation based on radicals or components.
- **Representational Characters**: Few hundred characters are representational, resembling their meaning.
- **Multiple Pronunciations and Meanings**: Many characters have multiple pronunciations and meanings, context-dependent.
- **Styles**: Classical Chinese (ancient) and Vernacular Chinese (modern) styles exist, with differences in vocabulary, grammar, and formality.
- **Romanization Systems**: Developed to write Chinese sounds in Western alphabetic languages, including Wade-Giles and Pinyin.
- **Pinyin**: Increasingly adopted, invented in the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China after 1949, for consistent representation of sounds.
- **Continued Use of Characters**: Despite advancements in romanization and computer technology, characters remain integral to written Chinese.
