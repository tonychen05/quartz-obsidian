A function of two variables is a relation $f:\mathbb{R}^2\to \mathbb{R}$ for which each input has one output.
	Example: $f(x,y)=x^2+3y$. Find $f(1,2)$
			$f(1,2)=(1)^2+3(2)=7$

We can **visualize** this by thinking that $f(x,y)$ associates a **height** to each point in the xy-plane. By setting $z=f(x,y),$ $z= x^2+3y$. The function *"lifts"* the point $(1,2)$ to a height $7$


> [!INFO] Define
> Given a function $f:\mathbb{R}^{2}\to \mathbb{R},$ the set of all $(x,y,z)$ so $z=f(x,y)$ is called the **graph** of $f(x,y)$ or **surface** defined by $f(x,y)$


> [!NOTE] Domain
> Unless otherwise specified, the domain of a function $f(x,y)$ will be the set of all $(x,y)$ for which **the formula that defines f is defined.** The domain is a *subset* of $\mathbb{R}^2$

> [!NOTE] Range
> The is the set of **all possible outputs of f.** The range is a subset of $\mathbb{R}$

> [!EXAMPLE] Domain and Range
> State the domain and range of $f(x,y)=\sqrt{ 4-2x^2-y^2 }$
> **Domain**: Need $4-2x^2-y^2\geq 0$
> - $2x+y^2\leq 4$
> - $\frac{x^2}{2}+\frac{y^2}{4}\leq 1$
> 
> **Range**: The range of $\sqrt{ \cdot }$ is $[0,\infty)$
> 
> ***Notation***:
> - **Domain**: ${\left\{ (x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^{2}| \frac{x^2}{2}+\frac{y^2}{4}\leq 1 \right\}}$
> - **Range**: $[0,2],\left\{ z \in \mathbb{R}|0\leq z\leq 2 \right\}$

# Level Curves
- Suppose $c$ is in the range of $f(x,y)$. The **level curve** associated to $z=c$ is the set of all $(x,y)\in \mathbb{R}^2$ for which $f(x,y)=c$
- The plot of level curves in the $xy$-plane is called a **contour plot.** Customarily, the value the function takes along them is also given.
