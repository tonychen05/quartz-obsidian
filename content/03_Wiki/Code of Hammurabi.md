The first legal codes, such as the Code of Hammurabi, indicate that advanced societies with mature civilizations existed many centuries ago. The Code of Hammurabi, once believed to be the oldest written law, was discovered in Mesopotamia and was inscribed on a pillar with an image of the sun god Shamash handing the code to Hammurabi. Unlike modern laws, it was a collection of specific judgments for particular cases rather than a comprehensive legal system. The code covered various aspects of life, including sexual behavior, property rights, and violence, forbidding personal revenge and establishing the "eye for an eye" principle, known as *lex talionis*. Although **secular**, the administration of these laws was mainly handled by priests, with Hammurabi bolstering his authority by linking the code to divine approval. The code represented a significant advancement in societal justice and governance.
