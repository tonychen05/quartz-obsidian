The combination of morphemes according to the rules of the language. In both [[Derivation|derivational]] and [[Inflection|inflectional]].

### Affixation
The process of forming words by adding affixes to other morphemes

**Prefix**
- English: surprised -> *un*surprised
**Suffix**
- English: believe -> believe*able*
**Infix** - inserted within the root morpheme
- Tagalog: lakad 'walk' -> l*um*akad 'to walk'
- No infix in English
**Circumfix** - an affix which has two parts, one placed at the start of a word, and the other at the end
- English: *en*light*en*

### Compounding
The process that forms new words not by means of affixes but by combining two or more independent words

**Compounding of Free Morphemes:**
- girl*friend*
- black*bird*
- text*book*

**Compounding of Affixed Words:**
- air-conditioner
- ironing board
- watch-maker

**Compounding of Compounded Words:**
- lifeguard chair
- aircraft carrier
- life-insurance salesman

### Reduplication
The process of forming new words by doubling either an entire free morpheme (total reduplication) or part of it (partial reduplication)

English makes no systematic use of reduplication as part of the language's grammar; there are nonsystematic cases such as 'bye-bye'

**Examples**:
- Indoneisan: rumah 'house' -> rumahrumah 'houses'

### Alternation
The use of morpheme-internal modifications in making new words or different grammatical forms of a word

**English:**
- m*a*n -> m*e*n
- g*oo*se -> g*ee*se

### Suppletion
The use of two or more phonetically distinct roots for different forms of the same word

**English:**
- good -> better -> best
- bad -> worse -> worst
