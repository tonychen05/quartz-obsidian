> Let $f$ be a continuous real-valued function defined on a *closed* interval $[a,b]$. Let $F$ be the function defined, for all $x$ in $[a,b],$ by $$F(x)=\int _{a}^{x}f(t) \, dt $$ Then $F$ is uniformly continuout on $[a,b]$ and differentiable on the *open interval* $(a,b)$, and $$F'(x)=f(x)$$ for all $x$ in $(a,b)$ so $F$ is an antiderivative of $f$.


> [!NOTE] Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (Newton-Leibniz theorem)
> Let $f$ be a real-valued function on a *closed interval* $[a,b]$ and $F$ a continuous function on $[a,b]$ which is an antiderivative of $f$ in $(a,b)$: $$F'(x)=f(x)$$ If $f$ is Riemann integrable on $[a,b]$ then $$\int _{a}^{b}f(x) \, dx = F(b)-F(a) $$

When an antiderivative $F$ of $f$ exists, then there are infinitely many antiderivatives for $f$, obtained by adding an arbitrary constant to $F$. Also, by the first part of the theorem, antiderivatives of $f$ always exist when $f$ is continuous.
