- Propositions - the senses expressed by sentences
- Truth values really do represent a relationship between the sense expressed by a sentence (a proposition) and the world
- Thus, we consider truth values to be the reference of sentences
- The conditions that would have to hold in the world in order for some proposition to be true are called truth conditions. 
- Understanding the proposition expressed by a sentence means understanding its truth conditions.
### Relationships between Propositions

#### Entailment
> [!NOTE] Entailment
> In entailment, **truth conditions** of one proposition guarantee the truth conditions of another.
> - If a sentence A entails a sentence B, sentence A cannot be true without B being true as well.
> 	- If A is true, B **HAS to be** true

Proposition expressed by (A) "All dogs bark" entails proposition expressed by (B) "Sallyâ€™s dog barks
	i.e. A *entails* B


Note that in reasoning about entailment, we are not concerned with actual truth values of propositions. Rather, we are evaluating their truth conditions.
	a. No dogs bark.
	b. Sally's dog doesn't bark.
		a entails b

**Mutual entailment**: when two propositions entail one another
	a. Ian has a female sibling
	b. Ian has a sister
	
**Incompatible entailment**: impossible for both propositions to be true
	a. No dogs bark
	b. All dogs bark

No entailment is possible:
	a. Ohio is a state
	b. I want to eat sushi

## Combining Lexical Expressions
### Combinations of Adjectives and Nouns

> [!NOTE] Pure Intersections
> the simplest form of adjectival combination **(intersective adjectives)**

![[insersective_adjectives_sketch.excalidraw]]

> [!NOTE] Relative Intersection
> nouns and adjectives that can't be combined **(subjective adjectives)**

Example:
large elephant & large mouse
![[subjective_adjective_sketch.excalidraw]]
Also with words like 'good' (a scale of quality)

#### Non-Intersection
- Two types:
	- General Type: phrases like: possible solution, alleged thief (because there are not necessarily a type of thief or solution)
	- **Anti-intersection** adjective: when the reference of the resulting expression cannot overlap with the noun's reference: a *fake Picasso* cannot refer to a *Picasso*
