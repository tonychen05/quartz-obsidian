- Global atmospheric CO2 levels have increased over the past 150 years.
- In 2021, the concentration is approximately 410 ppm
- Annual increase of atmospheric CO2 over the past 60 years is 100 times faster than caused by natural processes
- *Planetary Boundaries Framework* = idea that Earth's process contain environmental boundaries in which levels of human impact can be measured to keep us within safe zones
	- As of 2009, three boundaries, climate crisis, biodiversity loss, and nitrogen cycle have already been crossed and aren't sustainable. Ocean acidification, freshwater use, and deforestation are also concerns
- *Ecological Footprint* = measurement of the land required to product the resources we need and absorb the waste we product as an individual or as a community
- *Carrying Capacity* = population size that an area can support indefinitely
# What does a sustainable system look like?
- Renewable Energy
- Recycling Matter
- Population Control
- Local Biodiversity
## Obstacles to Sustainable Systems:
- **Unsustainable Development**: trade-off between short-term gain and long-term costs
- **Wealth Inequality**: 20% of people controls 80% of Earth's resources

# Environmental Ethics
Branch of philosphy that seeks to understand the moral relationship of human beings to the vironment and its non-human elements

## Three Different Worldviews
- **Anthropocentric worldview** = human lives and needs are most important
- **Biocentric worldview** = all life (biotic factors) have an intrinsic value and should be protected
- **Ecocentric worldview** = the entire ecosystem is most important including all biotic and abiotic factors (water, air, minerals, energy)
