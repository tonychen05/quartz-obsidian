A Greek tragedy written by Sophocles around 441 BCE.

### Summary
In this play, Antigone’s standards of natural justice clash with King Creon’s positivist law. The story revolves around two brothers leading opposite sides in Thebes’ civil war: Polyneices and Eteocles. Both brothers were killed in battle, and Creon, the new ruler of Thebes, declared that Eteocles would be honored and Polyneices disgraced. Polyneices had rebelled against the rightful ruler of Thebes. Creon therefore decreed that Polyneices was a traitor undeserving of a decent burial according to the law and that anyone attempting to give him one should be punished as a traitor. This is a problem because in Greek culture, the spirit of a body not buried by sundown on the day of death is doomed to walk the earth for eternity. Antigone was the sister of both brothers. Her position was that the gods have commanded the living to give the dead a proper burial and that she had a greater duty to the gods and to her brother than to the man-made law forbidding his burial, hence for her natural law outweighs man-made positivist law. In defiance of Creon, Antigone buries her brother and is arrested and condemned to death.

Haemon, Creon’s son and Antigone’s fiancé, tries to persuade his father to spare Antigone, and when Creon refuses, Haemon vows never to see his father again. Creon then imprisons Antigone in a cave, but a blind prophet tells him that the gods side with Antigone, that he will lose one child because of his actions, and that the sacrificial offerings of Thebes will not be accepted by the gods. Creon then relents and says that he will bury Polyneices and free Antigone. Before he can do this, however, he is informed that Haemon has killed himself and that so has Antigone. Another messenger informs him that his grief-stricken wife has killed herself, cursing Creon with her last breath. Thus chastened, Creon abdicates the throne a broken man, although he believes that the actions he had taken were in fact the right ones under the law as written.

### Analysis
- Who was right?
	- It might be easy to favor Antigone for her heroic stand, but Polyneices did commit treason and would have been punished under the law if he had survived

Issues such as those in Antigone assure that that there will always be a tension between ideas of natural and positivist law and between what is unwritten justice and what is contained in written law that may be unjust.
