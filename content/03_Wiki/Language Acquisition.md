## Order of Acquisition

1) [[Phonetics]] and [[Phonology]]
	- Children learn to identify sounds
	- Children start producing sounds
	- Learning articulatory gestures
2) [[Morphology]] and [[Syntax]]
	- Example of this stage is plurals
	- Adding -s to everything
		- Troubles with irregulars such as goose -> geese
	- **Overgeneralization:** using -s morpheme for all nouns (man > mans, foot > foots)
1) [[Semantics]]
	- Acquisition of word meaning is basically a trial-and-error process
	- **1-6 Years**: they learn 14,000 words, an average of 10 words a day
	- **Complexive Concepts**: Using a wrong or incomplete sets of characters (doggies = all fluffy things = slippers, other animals, and also small objects)
		- *no real unifying characteristics*
	- **Overextensions**: when a child extends the range of a word's meaning (moon = round = wheels)
	- **Underextensions**: application of word to a smaller set than appropriate (bird = flying birds != penguins)


## Hypotheses
### Innate Hypothesis
**Innate**: natural; something we are born with/genetically predisposed to already have at birth

**Innateness Hypothesis**: humans are genetically predisposed to acquire and use language
- basic foundation of all other hypothesis

### Critical Period
> [!NOTE] Critical Period
> A period during development (birth to puberty) when the acquisition of language is most likely

Proof:
- Neglected and feral children who have missed the critical period

### Imitation Theory
Children learn from those around them but doesn't explain other aspects of acquisition.
**Refuted, but still popular**

### Reinforcement Theory
Children praised, rewarded, and corrected, but children reject the corrections (train vs twain)
**Refuted, but still popular**

### Active Construction of a Grammar Theory
Children invent rules of grammar themselves and then create and edit their grammar until it matches adult grammar
**Most influential today**

### Connectionist Theories
Children create neural connections in the brain and are made through statistical information
**Also influential**

### Social Interaction Theory
Children learn from older children and adults; dependent on type of interactions
**Also influential**
