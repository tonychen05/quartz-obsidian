Morphology is the **linguistic study of how words are formed and the internal structure of words**. It examines how smaller meaningful units combine to create words and how this impacts their meaning and grammatical function. For example, in English, adding prefixes like "re-" to words like "do" or "play" modifies their meaning (e.g., "redo," "replay"). However, not all combinations are possible due to constraints within the language's morphological rules. For instance, while "re-" can be added to "do," it cannot be added to "danger" to form words like "redanger." **Morphology seeks to understand why certain combinations are permissible while others are not, based on the structure and rules of the language.**
