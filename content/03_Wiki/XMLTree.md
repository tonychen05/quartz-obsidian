All of the methods for *XMLTree* are **[[Java Static and Non-Static Method|instance methods]]**

There are two different classes that implement the XMLTree interface and either one may by used: XMLTree1 or XMLTree2

> [!QUESTION]- What's the point of the two difference classes?

XMLTree, is a [[Recursion|recursive]] structure just like the [[Tree]]
