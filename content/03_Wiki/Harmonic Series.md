> [!NOTE] Harmonic Series
> The **harmonic series** is the infinite series formed by summing all positive unit fractions:
> $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}{\frac{1}{n}}=1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{5}+\dots$$

This is a divergent series as proven according to the [[Integral Test for Convergence]]
