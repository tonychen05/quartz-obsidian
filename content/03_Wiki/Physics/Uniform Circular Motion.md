Imagine a moving object that can be modeled as a particle. If it moves in a circular path of radius $r$ at a constant speed $v$:

> [!INFO] Magnitude of Centripetal Acceleration
> $$a_{c} = \frac{v^2}{r}$$

> [!NOTE] Applying Newton's Second Law
> $$\Sigma F = ma_{c}=m \frac{v^2}{r}$$

> [!INFO] Period
> $$T=\frac{2\pi r}{v}$$

> [!INFO] Angular Speed
> $$\omega=\frac{2\pi}{T}$$
