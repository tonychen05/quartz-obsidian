Momentum is the quantity of motion of a moving body, measured as a product of its mass and velocity.

# Impulse
In physics, the quantity **Force * Time** is known as impulse. Expanding from [[Newton's Laws of Motion#Second Law]]:
> [!NOTE]
> $$F=ma$$ $$\text{or}$$ $$F=m\frac{\Delta v}{t}\to F\cdot t = m\Delta v$$

Thus, **Impulse = Change in Momentum**

# Conservation of Momentum
The conservation of momentum states that, within some problem domain, the amount of momentum remains constant; momentum is neither created nor destroyed, but only changed through the action of forces as described by [[Newton's Laws of Motion]].
