# First Law

> [!INFO] Newton's First Law
> A body remains at rest, or in motion at a constant speed in a straight line, unless acted upon by a force.

# Second Law

^44bd1c

> [!INFO] Newton's Second Law
> When a body is acted upon by a net force, the body's acceleration multiplied by its mass is equal to the net force.

> [!NOTE] Simply:
> $$F = ma$$where $F$ = force, $m$ = mass, and $a$ = acceleration

By "motion", Newton meant the quantity now calledÂ **[[Momentum]]**, which depends upon the amount of matter contained in a body, the speed at which that body is moving, and the direction in which it is moving. In modern notation, the momentum of a body is the product of its mass and its velocity:
> [!NOTE] Momentum
> $$\vec{p}=m \vec{v}$$

Thus, Newton's second law in modern form states force is equal to the time derivative of momentum
> [!NOTE] Newton's Second Law
> $$\vec{F}=\frac{d\vec{p}}{dt}$$
# Third Law

> [!INFO] Newton's Third Law
> If two bodies exert forces on each other, these forces have the same magnitude but opposite directions

> [!NOTE] Equation:
> $$\vec{F_{AB}}=-\vec{F_{BA}}$$
