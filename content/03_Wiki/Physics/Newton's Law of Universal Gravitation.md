Every particle in the Universe attracts every other particle with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.

> [!INFO] Magnitude of Gravitational Force
> If the particles have masses $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$ and are separated by a distance $r$, the magnitude of this gravitational force is
> $$F_{g} = G \frac{m_{1}m_{2}}{r^2},$$
> 
> where $G$ is a constant, called the *universal gravitational constant*.

>[!NOTE] Universal Gravitational Constant
>$$G=6.674 \times 10^{-11}N \cdot \frac{m^2}{kg^2}$$
