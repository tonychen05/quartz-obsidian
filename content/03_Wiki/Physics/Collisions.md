Collisions occur when one object strikes another. Problems involving collisions are usually solved using **conservation of momentum** and **conservation of energy**. There are two types of collisions: elastic collisions and inelastic collisions.

# Elastic Collision
An **elastic** collision is one in which ***both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved***.

> [!NOTE] Conservation of Momentum
> $$m_{1}{v_{1}}_{i}+m_{2}{v_{2}}_{i}=m_{1}{v_{2}}_{f}+m_{2}{v_{2}}_{f}$$
# Inelastic Collision
An **inelastic** collision is one in which ***only linear momentum is conserved***. This is because kinetic energy may be converted to other forms of energy and is thus, not conserved. However, total energy still is.

> [!NOTE] Conservation of Energy
> $$\frac{1}{2}m_{1}{{v_{1}}_{i}^2}+\frac{1}{2}m_{2}{{v_{2}}_{i}^2}=\frac{1}{2}m_{1}{{v_{1}}_{f}^2}+\frac{1}{2}m_{2}{{v_{2}}_{f}^2}$$

_A perfectly inelastic collision is an inelastic collision in which the two bodies stick together after the collision_. The **common velocity following a perfectly inelastic collision** between two bodies can be calculated in terms of the two mass values and the two initial velocities. 

> [!NOTE] Perfectly Inelastic Collision
> $$m_{1}{v_{1}}_{i}+m_{2}{v_{2}}_{i}=(m_{1}+m_{2})v_{f}$$

# Two-Dimensional Elastic Collision
A **two-dimensional elastic collision** in which an object $m_{1}$ moves along the $x$-axis and collides with $m_{2}$ initially at rest is illustrated in the figure below.

> $$m_{1}{v_{1}}_{i}=m_{1}{v_{1}}_{f}\sin \theta+m_{2}{v_{2}}_{f}\cos \theta$$

> [!NOTE] $y$-component
> $$0=m_{1}{v_{1}}_{f}\sin \theta-m_{2}{v_{2}}_{f}\sin \phi$$
