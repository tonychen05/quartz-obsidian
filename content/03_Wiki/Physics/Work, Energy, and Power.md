# Work
Work is the measure of energy transfer that occurs when an object is moved over a distance by an external force.

> [!CHECK] SI Unit
> Work is measured in **joules (J)** or $N\cdot m$

> [!NOTE] Work
> $$W = F\cdot d$$
> where $F$ = force and $d$ = displacement

# Energy
Energy is the capacity to do work.

> [!CHECK] SI Unit
> Energy is measured in **joules (J)** or $N\cdot m$

> [!NOTE] Gravitational Potential Energy
> $$GPE = mgh$$
> where $m$ = mass, $g$ = acceleration due to gravity, $h$ = height

> [!NOTE] Kinetic Energy
> $$KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$
> where $m$ = mass and $v$ = velocity

> [!NOTE] Spring Potential Energy
> $$PE_{S}=\frac{1}{2}k\Delta x^2$$
> where $k$ = spring constant and $\Delta x$ = change in position of spring

# Work-Energy Theorem

> [!INFO] Work-Energy Theorem
> The work-energy theorem states that the **net work done** by the forces on an object **equals the change in its kinetic energy**

> [!NOTE] Equation:
> $$W_{\text{net}}= \Delta KE$$
# Power
Power is the rate of doing work, and it is the amount of energy consumed per unit of time.

> [!NOTE] Equation:
> $$P = \frac{W}{t}$$

> [!CHECK] SI Unit
> Power is measured in **joules (J) per second (s)** or $\frac{N\cdot m}{s}$
