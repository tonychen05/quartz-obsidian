It explains the behavior of things that move very, very fast – as in, a significant fraction of the speed of light – where regular Newtonian physics doesn’t always apply. It’s called special relativity because it only applies to specific situations: where the different frames of reference aren’t accelerating (inertial reference frames)

Special relativity is built around two main assumptions, or postulates:
1. The laws of physics are the same in all inertial reference frames
2. The speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all observers

> [!TIP] Recall
> Speed * Time = Distance **BUT** special relativity says that the speed of light is always constant which means that the other two variables would have to change.

# Time Dilation
> [!NOTE] Equation:
> $$t = \frac{t_{0}}{\sqrt{ 1-\frac{v^2}{c^2} }}=\gamma t_{0},$$ where $t$ is time in the moving reference frame, $t_{0}$ is time in the stationary reference frame, $v$ is velocity, and $c$ is the speed of light.
# Length Contraction
If something is moving relative to you, its length in the direction that it's moving will seem shorter than it would if it wasn't moving.

> [!NOTE] Equation:
> $$l=\frac{l_{0}}{\gamma},$$ where $\gamma$ is $\frac{1}{\sqrt{ 1-\frac{v^2}{c^2} }}$, $l$ is length in direction of motion, and $l_{0}$ is length at rest
