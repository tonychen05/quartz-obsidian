There are **two** necessary conditions for equilibrium of an object:
1) The **net external force** acting on the object must equal zero. *The translational acceleration of the center of mass is zero*
2) The **net external torque** on the object about any axis must be zero. *The angular acceleration about any axis must be zero*

The **center of gravity** of an object is located at the center of mass when $g$ is uniform over the entire object. In order to compute the torque due to the weight, all the weight can be considered to be concentrated at a single point.
