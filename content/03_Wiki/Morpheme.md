> (one puzzle piece, one lego)

**Root**: contains 1 morpheme
**Stem**: can contain more than one morpheme
**Affixes**: a single morpheme
	- **Prefix**: before the root
	- **Suffixes**: after the root

Roots (e.g., "cat") and affixes (e.g., "-ed" for past tense) are morphemes.
Stems may contain more than one morpheme (e.g., "cattiness").

A few notes are in order about the terminology that we use to discuss morphemes. First, while a root by definition contains only one morpheme, a stem may contain more than one. For example, in cattiness, the root is cat, but the stem to which the derivational affix *-ness* is added is *catty*, which itself contains two morphemes, as we have already observed. Each affix is also a single morpheme.

> Some words, such as *Madagascar*, *cucumber*, or *pumpernickel*, are quite long but contain only one morpheme; other words, such as *ads*, are very short but contain two morphemes
