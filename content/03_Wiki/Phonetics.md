> [!NOTE] Three Types of Phonetics
> **Articulatory** - the study of the production of speech sounds
> **Acoustic** - the study of the transmissions and physical properties of speech sounds
> **Auditory** - study of the perception of speech sounds

> [!WARNING] English spelling does not imply sound
> The [k] sound can be seen in words such as:
> - quite
> - character
> - core

A good phonetic alphabet is **consistent and unambiguous** *i.e. 1 symbol = 1 sound* that represent sounds, not spelling.

> [!NOTE] International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)
> An alphabet created as a standardized representation of spoken language
> - Useful for figuring out how other languages/dialects are pronounced
> - Also useful for describing pronunciation differences between dialects
> 
> **Symbols must be exact; i.e. lowercase and uppercase are often different sounds**

Basic Unit are **phones** (sounds)
