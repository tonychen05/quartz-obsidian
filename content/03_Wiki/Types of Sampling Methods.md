## Simple Random Sampling

> [!INFO] Define: simple random sampling
> Every collection of $n$ population items is equally likely to comprise the sample.

For example, if the frame consists of $1,000,000$ serial numbers, the numbers $1,2,\dots ,\text{up to }1,000,000$ could be placed on identical slips of paper and drawn one by one until the sample size has been met.

When knowing values of some of the items does not help to predict the values of the others, this is called **independence**. This happens, for example in the above situation, if the number that is drawn is replaced with a slip of the exact same number. Thus, the population does not decrease and the same number could be drawn again with the exact chance it had when drawing first began.

## Convenience Sampling

> [!INFO] Define: convenience sampling
> Sample is obtained by selecting individuals or objects without systematic randomization

For example, a collection of bricks may be stacked in a way that is extremely difficult for those in the center to be selected. If the bricks on the top stack were somehow different than the bottom stack, resulting data would NOT be representative of the population.

Although convenience sampling is **easy**, it is also heavily **biased**.

## Stratified Sampling

> [!INFO] Define: stratified sampling
> Sample is obtained by breaking population into **strata** (mutually exclusive subgroups; no overlap)

For example, breaking the population of OSU students into freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior since no one can be in two groups of a time. Then, you sample from each strata which is then combined to form the overall sample.

## Systemic Sampling

> [!INFO] Define: systemic sampling
> Sample obtained following a specified system

For example, sampling every $k^{th}$ individual; i.e. every 3rd, 5th, 7th, . . . , etc.

## Cluster Sampling
> [!NOTE] Define: cluster sampling
> Sample is obtained by breaking population into **clusters** (mutually exclusive subgroups) and then sampling EVERYONE in SOME clusters

> [!WARNING] Different from stratified sampling
> In **stratified** sampling, you sample a **few people from each strata** but in *cluster* sampling, you sample *everyone from a few cluster*.

## Weighted Sampling

> [!NOTE] Define: weighted sampling
> Some items are given a greater chance of being selected

For example, a lottery where some have more tickets than others
