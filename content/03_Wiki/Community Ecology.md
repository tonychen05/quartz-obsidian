Community ecology is the study of these communities. They ask questions regarding:
- biodiversity
- community structure
- abundance of species
- distribution of species
- species interactions

## Species Affecting Community Structure
> [!INFO] Define: Niche
> The position or function a species plays within its community; including how it gets its energy and nutrients, its habitat requirements, how it survives and reproduces, and the other species or parts of the ecosystem that it interacts with.

Niche Specialists: specifies with a very specific habitat or resource requirements that can restrict where it can live (ex: fire salamander)

Niche Generalists: species who occupies a broad niche because it can utilize a wide variety of resources (ex: raccoon)

> [!INFO] Define: Keystone Species
> a species that impacts its community more than its mere abundance would predict, often imapcting ecosystem structure

Typical traits:
- may provide a unique service
- other species and the ecosystem depend on keystone species to survive and reproduce
- If lost, would create a "ripple effect" within community leading to less healthy community as a whole
- Examples: Sea otter, beaver, bees, grizzly bears, wolves, alligators, orcas, lions, and wild dogs

Scientists often recognize three types of keystone species:
- Predators (ex: wolf keeping deer population in check)
- Ecosystem Engineers (ex: beaver creating dams)
- Mutualists (ex: honey bee feed on nectar on flowers which can help flowers reproduce by spreading pollen)


> [!INFO] Define: Foundation Species
> a species that has a strong role in structuring a community by creating and maintaining habitat

Typical traits:
- Abundant in number and account for significant biomass in an ecosystem
- Numerous connections to other species
- Example: kelp


> [!INFO] Define: Invasive Species
> a species that was introduced to an area and is not native, and which typically does damage to the environment

Typical traits:
- Fast growing
- Reproduce quickly
- Tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions
- Survive on wide range of food sources
- Can thrive in areas occupied by humans
- Example: zebra mussle


> [!INFO] Define: Indicator Species
> a species that is particuluarly vulnerable to ecosystem perturbations, and that, when we monitor them, can give advance warning of a problem

Indicator species can signal both a healthy or unhealthy environment. They can show information about pollution, nutrient levels, salinity, temperature, or food availability and more.

Example: wood storks in the everglades.

## Interactions Between Species

Communities are defined as a group of interacting species occupying the same location. A community is living organisms bound together by their interactions and relationships between different species. 

We can better understand communities by examining how species interact with one another and the resulting effects that occur for each species. 

Changes within one species can result in cascading effects on other species within a community. We can describe and define interactions based on **positive, neutral, or negative effects** that the interactions have on the species involved.


> [!INFO] Define: Symbiosis
> Biological or ecological interactions between two species that live in close physical association (typically long-term relationships)

There are three forms this relationship can take:
- Mutualism - a symbiotic interaction between two species where both species benefit
	- bees and flowering plants
	- humans and digestive bacteria
	- oxpeckers and zebras or rhinos
- Commensalism - an association between individuals of two species in which one benefits, but the other neither benefits nor is harmed
	- livestock and egrets
	- sharks and suckerfish
	- milkweed and monarch butterfly
- Parasitism - An association between individuals of two species in which one benefits, and the other is harmed
	- fleas and ticks on pets
	- viruses and bacteria
	- cuckoo birds laying eggs in other birds' nests
	- mosquitoes and mammals



> [!INFO] Define: Predation
> A relationship between individuals of two species in which one organism, the predator, kills and consumes the other, the prey

Both predators and prey are strongly influenced by natural selection. Species have evolved numerous ways to evade predators.

Defense mechanisms can be classified as:
- Mechanical
- Chemical
- Physical
- Behavioral


> [!INFO] Define: Competition
> A relationship between individuals of two species in which both parties are harmed

Competition can be direct or indirect.

Examples:
- plant species competing for temperature, light, humidity, growing space, etc.
- animal species competing for water, food, shelter, prospective mates, etc.

A non-symbiotic biological interaction is **amensalism**:
- when one species inflicts harm on another species without any benefit OR harm to itself
	- Example: taller and wider tree capturing sunlight and shading out a smaller tree
- Two main types:
	- competition
	- antibiosis
		- one organism is unaffected while the other is damaged or killed by a chemical secretion
- generally not considered a significant interaction because it's unintential and doesn't benefit the species that causes the harm

In fact, competition causes harm to BOTH parties.

> [!INFO] Define: Competitive Exclusion Principle
> states that two species are unable to coexist within the same exact ecological niche

> [!INFO] Define: Resource Partitioning
> to coexist and avoid competition, different species utilize different parts of a resource that is limited, often using the resource in different ways

Communities allocate resources to reduce competition. In doing so, this allows more species to co-exist with one another with an ecosystem. This increases the ability of the entire community to capture energy and matter, thus benefitting all species living with the ecosystem.

## Energy Transfer within an Ecosystem

Ecosystems all share two common traits:
- Energy always flows in one direction
- Matter (chemical elements) are recycled and reused

Let's take a look at energy flow in an ecosystem. We first must be familiar with simple thermodynamics. 

> [!INFO] Define: [[Thermodynamics]]
> the study of energy transfer and energy transformation

1st Law of Thermodynamics: Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred or transformed to a different form.

2nd Law of Thermodynamics: When energy is transferred or transformed through an ecosystem, part of that energy is lost as heat, which cannot be used by living organisms to grow, survive or reproduce


> [!INFO] Define: Food Chain
> linear transfers of energy and matter from organism to organism

Many players involved in a food chain:
- Primary producers (ex: photosynthetic organisms)
- Primary consumers (ex: herbivores)
- Higher-level consumers (ex: carnivores)

A food chain is a single linear pathway for the transfer of energy. Starting with primary producer and ending with apex predator.


> [!INFO] Define: Trophic Level
> the position an organism occupies within an ecological pyramid (or food pyramid)

Depending on an organism's role in the community, it is assigned to a specific trophic level.

A **food web** shows multiple pathways or matter and energy transfers and is non-linear. It is a holistic model which shows the interconnected relationships of the community.

**Primary Producers**:
- make up first trophic level
- also known as autotrophs (make their own food)
- plants, algae, and phytoplankton are the most familiar type of primary produces and use photosynthesis to produce energy for growth and reproduction
**Consumers**:
- trophic levels above the producers
- can be primary, secondary, and so on
- Primary consumers are herbivores that directly consume the producers
- Consumers after the second trophic level can be herbivores, omnivores, or carnivores. The consumer that stands at the top is called the apex predator.
**Decomposer and Detritivores**:
- essential part of the food chain that is often forgotten
- feed on dead animal and plant remains and break down this material, recycling it into nutrients like carbon and nitrogen that primary producers then use to grow
- Examples: scavengers like vultures, worms, slugs, fungi, and bacteria

Typically, 90% of energy is lost as heat as you go up the trophic pyramid.

### Ecological Efficiency
As per the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics shows, energy is always lost when it is transferred from one trophic level to the next. As energy is transferred from primary producers to herbivores to carnivores, energy is lost as heat with each step up the pyramid.

This transfer of energy through the trophic pyramid is NOT very efficient. Typical efficiencies are 2-40%. This is known as **ecological efficiency**.

If we want to calculate the energy transfer efficiency between two trophic levels, we can use the formula for **trophic level transfer efficiency (TLTE)**

$$\text{TLTE}=\frac{\text{production at present trophic level}}{\text{production at previous trophic level}}\times 100$$
## Characteristics and Dynamics of Community Structure
Communities can be characterized by their structure and dynamics.

### Community Structure
Ecologists measure the composition of a community (**community structure**) by calculating **species richness** and **species evenness** and understanding how all the species relate and interact with one another (e.g., predator-prey, parasite-host).

Community structure is affected by both abiotic and biotic factors:
- climate (ex: precipitation, temperature)
- geography (ex: coastal, mountains)
- environmental characteristics (ex: heterogenous, homogenous)
- interactions between species (ex: mutualism, predation)

Community structure changes over time as they adapt through evolution to environment and anthropogenic changes or face extinction.

More ecological diversity -> creates opportunity for more niches -> more ways for energy to be exchanged

These factors increase a community's **resilience** (able to adapt to change).

There are two valuable ways to measure **ecological diversity**:
- species richness (total number of different species)
	- ecosystems near the equator tend to experience the highest species richness
- species evenness (how close in number each species is)
	- typically, fewer individual organisms at higher trophic levels
	- populations within the same trophic level should have similar numbers of individual organisms leading to a higher evenness
	- uneven communities with less abundant species are more at-risk to change and less able to respond to and withstand adverse situations

### Community Dynamics
Community dynamics are the changes to a community's structure and composition over time.

Communities that contain a relatively constant number of species are in equilibrium. This equilibrium is dynamic and varies with species types, numbers and their relationships with one another, which may change over time.

A disturbance will affect a community's ability to maintain an equilibrium state. A healthy community will be better able to withstand and respond to disturbances.

> [!INFO] Define: Ecological Succession
> the process of gradual change in the type and number of species of a community over time

Primary succession occurs in **new habitats** that have not yet been colonized by living organisms and are not affected by pre-existing communities.

Examples:
- lava flow from volcano
- exposed land from large landslide
- glacial till from retreating glacier

**Pioneer species** are the first species to colonize a barren ecosystem.
Typical traits:
- able to withstand harsh conditions
- adapted to reproduce by various means
- may have physical adaptations such as long roots, ability to grow on rocks, etc.
- survive prolonged dormancy

Secondary succession occurs more quickly (years to decades) than primary successions (centuries to millions of years) and is started because of a *disturbance* event that occurs in an **existing ecosystem**. For example, fires, avalanches, and floods.

A *disturbance* is an event (natural or anthropogenic) that alters an ecosystem. Events vary in frequency and impact. Disturbances can dramatically alter an ecosystem.

Examples:
- fires
- volcanic eruptions
- earthquakes
- clearcutting forest
- invasive species
- mountaintop removal
- climate change

A **climax community** is an ecological community in the final stage of succession in which the organisms remain stable and exist in balance with the ecosystem (thousands to millions of years).

Many communities never reach climax status because of habitat fragmentation (the discontinuance of a natural habitat).
- often caused by humans
- causes include: climate change, agriculture, urbanization

**Edge effects** are the changes in community structure that occur at the boundary between two habitats (ecotone)
- greater biodiversity can be found when two different ecosystems overlap as both ecosystems can occupy the area as well as unique species that are adapted to the edges

**Ecotone** is a zone of transition between two communities or habitats.
- boundary transitions can be very sharp and defined or gradual and not well defined
- may be formed naturally or may be created through human intervention

**Restoration ecology** is the study of repairing damaged ecosystems by human intervention. Restoration ecologists work to improve ecosystems that have been damaged due to disturbances. This work involves repopulating and reestablishing both planes and animals in the communities that have not been damaged.

Restoration actions include:
- revegetation
- habitat enhancement
- remediation

One specific area is **mine reclamation**:
- leveling or evening the land
- adding new topsoil or appropriate substrate
- re-seeding native vegetation
- monitoring the area
