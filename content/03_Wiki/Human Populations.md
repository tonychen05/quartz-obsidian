Since we emerged as our own species some 200,000 years ago, we have grown from a few thousand individuals to over 7 billion.

From 1700 to today, the human population has grown from less than 1 billion to over 7 billion largely due to the Industrial Revolution and increases in life expectancy.

> A branch of biology that deals with the number of individuals of a particular species found in an area and how and why those numbers increase or decrease over time

When applied to humans, we call it *demography*.

Exponential Population Growth:
- also known as logarithmic growth
- Growth depends on the size of population
	- small population = small growth
	- large population = large growth

> [!INFO] Define: Doubling Time
> amount of time required for the population to double in size, assuming the current growth rate remains constant

Exponential growth cannot last forever.

Bacteria population growth slows and eventually declines because of two main limiting factors:
1. Run out of resources (famine & war)
2. Waste products become toxic (pollution & disease)

China and the United States have about the same land area, but China has a much higher population and therefore greater population density

> [!INFO] Define: Population Density
> the number of people divided by land area

Bangladesh has the among the highest densities in the world.
The most densely populated areas in the world tend to be in coastal areas or close to major waterways.

About 90% of the people on Earth live on 10% of the surface area, and most are north of the equator.

> [!INFO] Define: Biocapacity
> The ability for a given area to both provide resources as well as assimilate waste

An area becomes unsustainable when their ecological footprint exceeds their biocapacity.

> [!INFO] Define: Ecological Footprint
> The impact of a person or community on the environment, expressed as the amount of land requried to sustain their use of natural resources

Every environment has a **carrying capacity**: the maximum population size the area can support.

As our population grows, so does our demand for natural resources. At our current rate of consumption, the human population is using **1.75 earths** worth of resources.

Growth Rate:
- percent increase of population size over time
- affected by births, deaths, and the number of people moving into or out of a regional population

Zero Population Growth:
- occurs when the number of people born equals the number of people dying; in other words, **replacement fertility rate** is reached
- Reaching zero population growth takes two steps:
	- identifying why birth rates are high
	- taking steps to reduce them

But why are birth rates so high?

Pronatalist Pressures:
- policies or cultural beliefs that encourage families to have more children (i.e. work the family farm, tend to household chores, care for aging parents, religious beliefs, high prestige or social status)
- agrarian societies tend to have high pronatalist pressures
- high infant mortality rate and desire to have survivors

Demographic Factors:
- health, education, economic conditions, and cultural influences
- large differences between developed and developing nations
- higher death rate in developed nations due to aging population
- higher infant mortality rates in developing nations reveal the differences in quality of life and health care

**Demographic transition** is a sequence of 5 stages. It suggests that as a country's economy changes from preindustrial to postindustrial, low birth and death rates replace high birth and death rates.
- Most population growth occurs during this transition when death rates are lower than birth rates
- The fastest growing regions are those with a youthful or very young population

During the demographic transition, death rates decease before birth rates. This is because death rates are influenced more by advances in technology and birth rates are more influenced by culture .

Demographers use **age structure diagrams** to predict the future growth potential of a population.

The higher the growth rate, the more quickly a population will double.
Less Developed Countries (LDCs) generally have high growth rates.
Highly Developed Countries (HDCs) generally have low growth rates.

**Rule of 70**
Doubling Time for World Population = $(70/\text{annual growth rate})$

Worldwide, population growth rates are **declining**, but the **overall number is still greater than zero**, so the world population is still growing. 

How to reduce birth rates?

**Top-Down approach to Population Planning**
- 1959-1961 - Great Chinese Famine (starvation deaths = tens of millions)
- 1970's - shortage of consumer goods (i.e. soap, eggs, sugar, cotton)
- Government blamed overpopulation and so initiated the **One-Child Policy (1979)**
	- claimed the policy prevented 400 million Chinese births
	- enforced the policy with controversial methods - forced sterilization and abortions, infanticide, and restriction of health care for unsanctioned children
	- Experts except that due to demographic transition, the birth rates would have declined without the One-Child Policy

**Bottom-up approach to Population Planning**
- factors that decrease the death rate can also decrease overall population growth rates
- programs that address the needs of a population and work within cultural and religious traditions are the most successful for reducing pronatal pressures
- social justice issues associated with overpopulation must be resolved

Many demographers believe addressing **social justice issues,** especially improving the health and well-being of women and children, will reduce total fertility rates.

As nations industrialize and incomes increase, the demand for resources also increases. However, the price that we pay for various goods does not reflect their true costs. The environmental and social costs are often left out of the ticket price.
	Solutions: buy less, buy only from socially and environmentally responsible companies, purchase quality made items with long functional lives, buy second hand

Higher incomes and urbanization are associated with an increased demand for meat and animal proteins. While the global meat industry provides food and a livelihood for billions of people, it also has significant environmental and health consequences for the planet
	Solutions: reduce amount of meat and other animal products consumed. Ideally this means a vegan or vegetarian diet, but cutting meat out of even one mean/day a week will reduce ecological footprint
