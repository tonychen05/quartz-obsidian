## Chinese and Japanese Immigrants in the United States

**Chinese Immigrants**:
- **Early Arrivals and Discrimination**: Chinese immigrants began arriving in the U.S. during the Gold Rush of 1848, initially intending to return home. Upon arrival, they faced legal and extralegal harassment, including special taxes, barriers to land ownership and citizenship, and violent attacks (Kitano & Daniels, 1995).
- **Stereotypes and Employment**: Chinese immigrants were subjected to derogatory stereotypes and harsh working conditions, likened to a form of modern slavery. They faced accusations of living in filth, spreading disease, and having questionable character (Kitano & Daniels, 1995).
- **Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882**: This law, which was passed without legal challenge, aimed to prevent Chinese laborers from entering the U.S. and restricted their naturalization rights. Although repealed in 1943, the act significantly affected Chinese immigration and integration.

**Legal Battles and Citizenship**:
- **In re Ah Yup (1878)**: The court ruled that only individuals of European or African descent were eligible for naturalization.
- **United States v. Wong Kim Ark (1898)**: Affirmed that individuals born in the U.S. were citizens, regardless of their parentsâ€™ nationality, countering attempts to deny citizenship to American-born Chinese.
- **Ozawa v. United States (1922)**: The Supreme Court ruled that foreign-born Asians could not become naturalized citizens, despite the Wong Kim Ark decision.

**Japanese Immigrants**:
- **Assimilation and Education**: Japanese immigrants faced less severe discrimination compared to Chinese immigrants and were integrated into schools by the early 1900s. However, this did not shield them from major discriminatory events later.

**World War II Internment**:
- **Executive Order 9066 (1942)**: Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, this order led to the forced relocation and internment of over 110,000 Japanese Americans, most of whom were U.S. citizens. They were placed in internment camps under harsh conditions (Parrillo, 2003).
- **Korematsu v. United States (1944)**: The Supreme Court upheld the internment as constitutionally permissible during wartime, though the decision was later widely criticized. Fred Korematsu, who resisted internment, had his conviction overturned in 1983 (Daniels, 2002).
- **Ex Parte Endo (1944)**: The Court ruled that the government could not detain a citizen who was loyal to the U.S., leading to the release of internees and beginning the process of redress.

**Redress and Apology**:
- **Civil Liberties Act of 1988**: Provided a formal apology and compensation of $20,000 to surviving Japanese American internees. This was a significant acknowledgment of the injustice faced by Japanese Americans during WWII (Parrillo, 2003).

**Contemporary Status**:
- **Success and Integration**: Despite historical challenges, Asian Americans, particularly those of Chinese and Japanese descent, have achieved high levels of educational attainment, professional success, and economic stability. They generally experience lower crime rates and greater marital stability compared to the general population. This success is often attributed to cultural values emphasizing ambition, persistence, and deferred gratification (Wong, 2015).
