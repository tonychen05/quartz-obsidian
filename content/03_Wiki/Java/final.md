>[!INFO] Definition: final
>An initialized variable whose value cannot change is called a *constant variable*. A constant variable is also known as a **final variable**. A common convention, or good practice, is to name constant variables using upper case letters with words separated by underscores, to make constant variables clearly visible in code.

> [!EXAMPLE]
> ```java
> final double SPEED_OF_SOUND   = 761.207; // Miles/hour (sea level)
> final double SECONDS_PER_HOUR = 3600.0;  // Secs/hour
