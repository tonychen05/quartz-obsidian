## Analytic Language
Comprised of sequences of free morphemes.
- Each word consists of a single morpheme, maintaining meaning and function independently.
- Purely analytic languages are also known as isolating languages.

**Characteristics:**
- Do not use affixes for word composition.
- Express semantic and grammatical concepts through separate words.
**Example: Mandarin Chinese:**
- Highly analytic structure.
- Plurality and past tense communicated through invariant function words rather than affixes.
	**Illustrative Examples:**
	- Example sentences demonstrate the use of function words in Mandarin to convey concepts:
		1. "I play piano. (wo tan ganqin)"
		2. "I plural play piano past. (wo men tan ganqin le)" 
## Synthetic Language 

> [!INFO] Definition: Synthetic Language
> languages that attach affixes to morphemes

### Three Types:
#### Agglutintal
A synthetic language that has morphemes joined together loosely
- Easy to determine boundaries of the morphemes
- Usually only one meaning per affix
#### Fusion
- Fusional languages, a subtype of synthetic language, form words by adding bound morphemes to stems.
	- Unlike agglutinating languages, affixes in fusional languages may not be easily separable from the stem.
	- Affixes are fused with the stem, and there are often alternations to forms of both the stems and affixes.
**Example: Spanish:**
- Spanish is a fusional language with inflectional suffixes attached to verb stems.
- These suffixes indicate person, number, and tense of the subject of the verb.
**Characteristics of Fusional Languages:**
- Difficulty in isolating stem and suffix due to fusion.
- Affixes in fusional languages often convey multiple meanings simultaneously.
**Illustrative Examples from Spanish:**
1. "hablo" - "I am speaking"
2. "habla" - "s/he is speaking"
3. "hablé" - "I spoke"
**Analysis of Spanish Verb Forms:**
- Morphemes can be isolated:
- "[-o]" - first-person singular present tense
- "[-a]" - third-person singular present tense
- "[-é]" - first-person singular past tense
- However, the stem "habl-" [aβl] never appears in isolation in Spanish.
**Comparison with Agglutinating Languages:**
- While in agglutinating languages one meaning is usually indicated by each affix, in fusional languages, a single affix often conveys several meanings simultaneously.
#### Polysynthetic
- In polysynthetic languages, complex words are formed by combining several stems and affixes.
- Nouns (subjects, objects, etc.) are integrated into verb forms.
**Example: Sora:**
- Sora language spoken in India exhibits polysynthesis.
- Incorporates objects (subjects, instruments, etc.) into verbs.
**Illustrative Examples from Sora:**
1. "[aninɲamjɔten]" - "He is fish-catching"
 - Morpheme breakdown: [anin - ɲam - jɔ - te - n]
2. "[ɲamkɪdtenai]" - "I will tiger-catch"
 - Morpheme breakdown: [ɲam - kɪd - te - n - ai]
