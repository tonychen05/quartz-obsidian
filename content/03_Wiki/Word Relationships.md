## Hyponyms
> [!INFO] Define: Hyponymy
> Word X is a **hyponym** of word Y if the set referred to by X is always included in the set referred to by Y.

ex: "Poodle" is a hyponym of "dog," as all poodles are dogs
![[Hyponymy_sketch]]

- **Hypernym:** the more general, generic term
	- ex: *color* is a hypernym of *purple*
- **Hyponym:** the more specific term
	- ex: *purple* is a hyponym of *color*
- **Co-hyponym:** hyponyms of the same hypernym
	- ex: *purple* and *green* are sister terms

## Antonymy
> [!INFO] Define: Antonymy
> Words with related meanings but contrasting senses.

- **Complementary Antonyms:** Two words where everything falls into one category or the other, but not both.
	- *Examples*:
		- married/unmarried
		- smoking/nonsmoking
- **Gradable Antonyms:** Represent points on a continuum, allowing for degrees between the extremes.
	- *Examples*:
		- wet/dry (completely wet to completely dry; with varying degrees of moisture in between)
		- wide/narrow (size range)
		- hot/cold (temperature range)
- **Reverses:** Pairs suggesting movement where one word undoes the action implied by the other.
	- *Examples*:
		- expand/contract
		- grow/shrink
- **Converses:** Opposing points of view or perspectives requiring both members of the pair for reference (i.e. closely related words that can't exist without each other).
	- *Examples*:
		- lend/borrow (If someone lends something, then someone else must borrow it.)
		- send/receive (For sending to occur, there must be someone to receive the item.)

## Synonymy
Two words are **synonymous** if they have exactly the same reference.
   
**Example:** "Couch" and "sofa" are synonyms, referring to the same set of objects.

Synonymous words may have slightly different senses but refer to identical sets of entities.
