# The Environment
> [!INFO] Define: Environment
> Specific set of physical and biological conditions in a given time and space that support the growth, development, and reproduction of life

Differentiated by **physical** and **biological** environment:
- **Physical** - incoming radiant energy of the sun, air, water, and soil minerals (all required for life on Earth)
- **Biological** - encompasses organic molecules (C-H bonds), organisms, and their relationships with one another

# Environmental Science
> [!INFO] Define: Environmental Science
> Interdisciplinary study of humanity's relationship with other organisms and Earth

Environmental science is an **applied** science relying on a combination of natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities to better understand the planet and to discover solutions to environmental problems.

## Solving Problems
Develop solutions to environmental problems is challenging as *environmental literacy* is required and many of the problems are known *wicked problems*. 

> [!INFO] Define: Environmental Literacy
> Understanding natural systems and environmental problems in order to make informed decisions involving sustainability and the environment

> [!INFO] Define: Wicked Problems
> Problems that are difficult or impossible to solve due to scale and complexity

Wicked problems, like global warming, is **multifaceted**: there are many **causes**, **consequences**, **possible actions**, and **opinions differ between groups**.

Solving environmental problems requires consideration of the *triple bottom line*.

> [!NOTE] Define: Triple Bottom Line
> Considering the combination of environmental, social, and economic impacts of our choices and decisions

### Social Traps
Sometimes, solutions fall into *social traps*.

> [!INFO] Define: Social Traps
> Decisions that seem good in the short-term but lead to negative outcomes in the long-term
> - Ex: consumers want fish -> catch more fish -> fish population reduce

**Three common social traps**:
- Tragedy of the Commons: shared natural resources are not owned by anyone but individuals who try to maximize benefit harm the resource for everyone
	- Ex: sharing an open range with farmers where cows roam freely -> if one farmer adds 100 cows, open range degraded -> no grass for cow
- Time Delay: time shifts a natural resource from positive to negative over time as it not able to be regenerated at a fast enough rate
	- Ex: cutting trees too fast -> deforestation
- Sliding Reinforcer: solution that are helpful at first but become more harmful over time
	- Ex: pesticide -> pesticide-resistant bugs -> need better pesticide -> more bugs
