>  Phonology is the study of how sounds are organized within a language and how they interact with each other. 


> [!WARNING] DIFFERENCE from [[PHONETICS]]
>  Phonetics is the study of speech sounds as physical entities: how they are produced in the vocal tract, what their articulatory and acoustic properties are, and how they are interpreted. Phonologists ask the following kinds of questions: What is the organization of sounds in a given language? Within a language, are there particular sounds whose distribution with regard to other sounds is predictable in some way? Which sounds are used in a language to distinguish between words?

# Phonotactic Constraints
- Rules and restrictions on sound combinations
	- Different in every language
	- Referring to phones (sounds)

## In Sign Language
- Handshapes
- Movements
- Where and when they can be used

# Foreign Accents
- when a speaker appliers their phonotactic constraints to another language that they are speaking
	- Spanish: student > [ɛstudɛnt]
		- Spanish does not allow [st] at the beginning of a word

# Phoneme and Allophone 

> [!INFO] Definition: Phoneme
> a set of speech sounds that are perceived to be variants of the same sound (represented with //)

Ex: /t/ -> [t], [ʔ], [ɹ]


> [!INFO] Definition: Allophone
> the word for a member of the phoneme set
> - Represented with []
> 	- allo- means different
> 	- Phone means sound
> 	- so, different sounds

# Phonological System
## Two Levels:

> [!INFO] Definition: Phonological segments
> psychological (abstract) concepts, what we store in our brain
> - Phonemes

> [!INFO] Definition: Phonetic segments
> concrete sounds, representing how we really pronounce them
> - /t/ = `[t][ʔ][th][ɾ]`
> - Allophones
