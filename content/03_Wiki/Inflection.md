The creation of different grammatical forms of words is called **inflection**, and a set of inflectionally related forms from a common root is called a **paradigm**.

Another  way  of  capturing  the  difference  between  derivation  and  inflection  is  that  derivation produces a different **lexeme**, while inflection does not. 

A **lexeme** is the abstract core concept that a word represents. The words do, does, and done are different in terms of the grammatical information expressed, but they still share the same core concept (the act of doing). This means that all three words are variants of the same lexeme DO.
