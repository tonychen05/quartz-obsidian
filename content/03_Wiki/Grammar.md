# Prescriptive Grammar
> [!NOTE] Definition
> Socially embedded notion on "correct" or "proper" ways to use language; these are the rules of judgement about "correctness"

i.e. "grammar police"

## What's Wrong With Prescriptive?
- These rules don't reflect actual language
- Non-standard dialects are still frowned upon
- It's a social status thing
- Language changes over time but current speakers do not always accept change
# Descriptive Grammar 
> [!NOTE] Definition
> Description of the rules of a language as it is spoken, this accepts all varieties, including the ones prescriptivists don't like


> [!CHECK] Linguist are interested in learning about people's languages, not policing them
