## The Early Years of American Indian Policy and Discrimination
- **Pre-Colonial Population and Culture**:
	- **Estimates**: Before European colonization, the American Indian population in what is now the United States was estimated to be between 6 and 10 million, spread across approximately 300 distinct tribes (Parrillo, 2003).
	- **Loss of Culture**: The impact of European expansion led to significant loss of both population and cultural heritage, including many languages and traditions.
- **Early Colonial Interactions**:
	- **Initial Relations**: Interactions between early colonists and Native Americans varied from peaceful coexistence to violent conflict. Early European settlers admired Native Americans as “noble savages,” but as settlement expanded, they increasingly viewed them as threats, leading to hostile confrontations.
	- **Enslavement**: Native Americans were enslaved in the colonies, although this practice declined as African slaves became the primary labor force. For example, a 1708 census in Carolina recorded 2,900 enslaved Africans and 1,400 enslaved Indians (French, 2003).
- **Physical Genocide**:
	- **Bounties and Violence**: Physical violence against Native Americans included practices such as paying bounties for Indian scalps in colonial Massachusetts (Parrillo, 2003). These acts were part of broader policies of displacement and destruction.
- **British Policies and Proclamation Act of 1763**:
	- **Proclamation Act**: In response to conflicts with Native Americans and the French, the British government issued the Proclamation Act of 1763. This act restricted settlement beyond the Appalachian Mountains and required that land transactions with Native Americans be conducted with royal oversight. This policy aimed to protect Native lands but also laid the groundwork for future U.S. policies (Parrillo, 2003).
- **Northwest Ordinance of 1787**:
	- **Land and Trade**: The Northwest Ordinance established procedures for surveying and settling lands in the Northwest Territories and gave Congress the sole right to trade with Native Americans. Despite promises of fair treatment, the ordinance pertained to areas previously protected by the Proclamation Act.
- **Constitutional Recognition**:
	- **Article I, Section 8**: The U.S. Constitution granted Congress the power to regulate commerce with Indian tribes, recognizing their quasi-independent status but not their full sovereignty.

## The Marshall Trilogy: Defining Indian Status
1. **Johnson v. McIntosh (1823)**:
	- **Discovery Doctrine**: This case established the Discovery Doctrine, which held that European powers (and their successors, such as the United States) had exclusive rights to extinguish Native American land titles. The Supreme Court ruled that Native Americans were mere occupants of the land with no sovereign rights (Wilkins, 1997).
1. **Cherokee Nation v. Georgia (1831)**:
	- **Domestic Dependent Nations**: The Court ruled that the Cherokee Nation was not a foreign nation but rather a “domestic dependent nation.” This classification meant that the Cherokees had a dependent relationship with the U.S. government, akin to wards under guardianship, and lacked the standing to bring cases directly to the Supreme Court (Wilkins, 1997).
2. **Worcester v. Georgia (1832)**:
	- **Federal Authority**: In a partial victory for Native Americans, the Court ruled that the Cherokee were a distinct community and that Georgia’s laws did not apply to them. However, this decision was ignored by President Andrew Jackson, who reportedly dismissed the ruling, emphasizing the federal government’s limited ability to enforce the decision against state actions (Parrillo, 2003).

The Marshall Trilogy established the legal framework for U.S. policy toward Native Americans, defining their status in ways that subordinated their sovereignty and rights to federal and state interests. Despite these rulings, Native American lands continued to be encroached upon, and their rights frequently disregarded by both federal and state authorities.

## The Period of Removal and Physical Genocide

**Indian Removal and the Trail of Tears**:
- **Indian Removal Act**: Passed in 1830, this act mandated the forced relocation of Native American tribes from their ancestral lands in the Southeast to designated Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma). This policy was part of the broader agenda of Manifest Destiny, which justified American expansion across the continent.
- **Trail of Tears**: The Cherokee Nation's forced march in 1838–1839 exemplified the brutality of this policy. Over 1,000 miles were covered in harsh winter conditions, resulting in the deaths of about 25% of the Cherokee population (French, 2003). This tragic event is a symbol of the broader suffering inflicted on many tribes.

**Manifest Destiny and Expansion**:
- **Territorial Acquisitions**: Manifest Destiny was the ideological justification for the Mexican-American War (1846–1848), the annexation of Texas, and other territorial expansions, including the Gadsden Purchase and the settlement of the Pacific Northwest. These expansions further encroached upon Native American lands, bringing tribes such as the Apache, Navajo, and Nez Perce under increasing American control.

**Displacement of the Dakota Sioux**:
- **Land Loss and Uprisings**: The Dakota Sioux were expelled from 35 million acres of fertile land in the early 1830s in exchange for unfulfilled promises of payment. This led to starvation and disease among the Sioux. Subsequent relocations further displaced them, eventually leading to uprisings and their movement to Nebraska.

**Standing Bear v. Crook (1879)**:
- **Legal Status of Native Americans**: This landmark case involved Standing Bear of the Ponca Tribe, who had left the Oklahoma reservation and was arrested. The court ruled that Native Americans were indeed "persons" under U.S. law, not mere objects of control. This case marked a shift from physical genocide to a focus on cultural destruction (French, 2003).

## The Assimilation Period and Cultural Genocide

**Destruction of Buffalo Herds**:
- **Buffalo and Dependency**: The near-extinction of buffalo herds, which was partly driven by government policies and private enterprises, devastated the Plains Indians. The buffalo was central to their way of life, and its destruction forced many to move onto reservations and contributed to the erosion of their cultures.

**End of Treaty-Making**:
- **Legislative Control**: In 1871, Congress ended treaty-making with Native American tribes, asserting that all Indian matters would henceforth be handled through legislation. This shift solidified the federal government's unilateral control over Indian affairs and marked the beginning of a period characterized by assimilation policies (Cherokee Tobacco case, 1871).

**Assimilation Efforts**:
- **Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA)**: Established in 1824, the BIA became central to efforts aimed at assimilating Native Americans. It oversaw the provision of resources, education, and enforcement of cultural changes. The agency played a significant role in dismantling traditional tribal justice systems and imposing federal jurisdiction through laws like the Major Crimes Act of 1885.

**General Allotment Act (Dawes Act) of 1887**:
- **Land Allotment**: The Dawes Act aimed to divide reservation lands into individual plots, with the intention of integrating Native Americans into American society as individual farmers. However, it resulted in the loss of two-thirds of Native lands to white settlers and did not achieve its goal of creating self-reliant farmers.

**Resistance and Legal Challenges**:
- **Tribal Resistance**: Many tribes resisted the allotment and assimilation efforts, including the Five Civilized Tribes. The 1898 act imposed allotments in Oklahoma and curtailed tribal governance, further disrupting traditional practices.

- **Elk v. Wilkins (1884)**: The Supreme Court ruled that Native Americans were not considered citizens and therefore could not claim voting rights, reinforcing their status as wards rather than citizens.

- **Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock (1903)**: This case involved the government's decision to open surplus lands in Oklahoma to white settlement. The Supreme Court upheld Congress's plenary power to abrogate treaties, further legitimizing the dispossession of Native lands.

## The Beginning of the End of Cultural Genocide

**Indian Citizenship Act of 1924**:
	- **Citizenship**: This act granted American citizenship to all Native Americans, marking a significant shift in their legal status and acknowledging their rights under U.S. law.

**Indian Reorganization Act of 1934**:
	- **Policy Shift**: Enacted under President Franklin D. Roosevelt, this act ended the practice of cultural genocide. It promoted the revival of Native cultures, ended the allotment system, and encouraged the consolidation of tribal lands. However, it also pressured tribes to adopt Western-style political institutions and retained federal oversight.

**Termination Policy (1953)**:
	- **Termination and Its Impact**: This policy aimed to fully assimilate Native Americans into mainstream society by terminating federal supervision and encouraging migration to urban areas. The result was a loss of federal support for reservations, leading to the disintegration of tribal structures and increased hardship for Native communities.

**Indian Self-Determination Act of 1975**:
	- **Policy Reversal**: The Self-Determination Act marked a reversal of the termination policy, promoting tribal self-governance and recognizing the rights of tribes to manage their own affairs. This shift was influenced by Native American activism, including protests and occupations led by organizations such as the American Indian Movement.

The historical trajectory of U.S. policies towards Native Americans reflects a shift from outright physical genocide to attempts at cultural genocide, followed by a gradual acknowledgment of Native sovereignty and self-determination. Despite periods of significant setbacks, these policies and legal battles have shaped the ongoing struggle for Native American rights and recognition.
