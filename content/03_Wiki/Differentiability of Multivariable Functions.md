# Differentiability
We will say $f(x,y)$ is differentiable at $(a,b)$ if the graph of $f(x,y)$ looks more and more like a plane as zoom in at $(a,b,f(a,b))$. This plane is called the [[tangent plane]].

> [!NOTE]- Similarity to [[Tangent Line]]
> If $f'(a)$ exists, then the graph of $f(x)$ looks like a line near $(a,f(a))$

> [!WARNING] [[Partial Derivatives]] and Differentiability
> Just because the partial derivatives exist at $(a,b)$ does **NOT** mean that function $f(x,y)$ is differentiable at $(a,b)$

> [!INFO] Theorem: Differentiability
> - If $f_{x}(x,y)$ and $f_y(x,y)$ are continuous at $(a,b)$, then $f(x,y)$ is differentiable at $(a,b)$.
> - If $f(x,y)$ is differentiable at $(a,b)$, then $f_{x}(a,b)$ and $f_{y}(a,b)$ exist
> - If $f(x)$ is differentiable at $(a,b)$, then $f(x,y)$ is continuous at $(a,b)$.

*Differentiability is a subtle notion; we will not study it in depth.*
