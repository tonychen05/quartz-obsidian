# Prehistory to Neolithic Era (prehistory + 10,000-1600 BCE)

> [!ABSTRACT] Abstract
> The section provides insights into the early human inhabitants of East Asia, featuring the notable "Peking Man" (Homo erectus) and other hominids dating back nearly one million years. The discovery of "Peking Man" near Beijing in 1927 is detailed, including the associated artifacts and estimated age. The narrative then transitions to the Neolithic Period in East Asia, starting around 9500 BCE, marking the shift from hunter-gatherer societies to settled agricultural cultures. The cultivation of rice and millet, along with cultural developments and the use of polished stone tools, is highlighted. The section also explores specific artifacts, such as ancient Japanese pottery and the distinctive Dogu figurines from the Jomon Period, offering unique insights into early East Asian cultures and practices.

## Early Inhabitants of East Asia:
- Early human inhabitants of East Asia included "Peking Man" (Homo erectus) and similar hominids in southwest China dating nearly one million years ago.
- "Peking Man" was discovered in 1927 at Zhoukoudian near Beijing, China, with bones, craniums, jaws, teeth, skeletal bones, and stone tools, estimated to be between 500,000 and 300,000 years old.

## Neolithic Period in East Asia:
- The Neolithic Period in East Asia began around 9500 BCE, marked by the transition from hunter-gatherer societies to settled agricultural cultures.
- The cultivation of rice and millet in Neolithic China and East Asia is depicted in a map, showcasing the development of horticultural practices in Korea and Japan.
- Village culture, animal husbandry, and agriculture spread across the region during this time, characterized by the use of advanced polished stone tools.
- Small local cultures adapted to geographical conditions, especially along river valleys and coastal areas.
- The Neolithic era ended with the introduction of metal tools in the Bronze, Copper, or Iron Age.

## Cultural Developments and Artifacts:
- Archaeologists discovered pottery in Japan dating back to 8,000 BCE, the world's oldest on record.
- Yangshao culture, a Yellow River Neolithic culture, cultivated millet and rice, producing painted pottery with human, animal, and geometric designs.
- The Jomon Period (c. 12,000 – 300 BCE) in Japan is characterized by cord-marked pottery, often used for cooking and made by women.
- Dogu figurines from the Jomon Period depict distorted human figures with oversized heads, small arms, and compact bodies.
- Dogu figures were possibly used in sympathetic magic, where illness or misfortune could be transferred to the figurine, which would then be deliberately broken to cure the ailment or dispel bad luck.
# The Early Kingdoms Era (1600 BCE- 600 CE)

## Chinese Dynasties
> [!NOTE] Early Kingdoms and Empires in China
> - **Shang (1600-1100 BCE)**: Yellow River, kingdoms, writing (oracle bones), bronze
> - **Zhou (1100-221 BCE)**: feudal state, cast iron, philosophies: Confucianism and Taoism (Daoism)
> - **Qin (221-207 BCE**): first centralized empire; Emperor Qinshi Huangdi; terra-cotta warriors
> - **Han (206 BC – 220 AD)**: Yirst long-lasting Chinese empire
> 

### The Shang Dynasty
- The Shang Dynasty (1600-1100 BCE) was the first historical kingdom in the region.
- Ruled by smaller number of aristocratic families in walled urban complexes, with commoners living in villages and serving in Shang armies.
- Characterized by the development of regional kingdoms, class divisions, the invention of writing, and sophisticated use of bronze for weapons and ritual vessels.
- Shang bronze tripod (ding) used for cooking, storage, and rituals, with inscriptions in early written Chinese on tortoise shells or ox scapulae.
### The Zhou Dynasty
- The Zhou Dynasty (1100-221 BCE) succeeded the Shang, featuring a feudal system with small regional states.
- **Philosophical growth during this era**, including the teachings of Kongzi (**Confucius**), Mencius, and Xunzi.
- **Cast iron** for tools and weapons became important towards the end of the Zhou as states fought to replace the dynasty.
### The Qin Dynasty
- The Qin Dynasty (221-207 BCE) followed the Zhou, characterized by centralized bureaucracy rule under Qinshi Huangdi.
- Qinshi Huangdi established an absolute monarchy, **standardized the written language, weights, and measures.**
- Built the Great Wall, a massive tomb with a terra-cotta army, influencing later dynasties and kingdoms.

> [!WARNING] Sanxingdui Culture / Kingdom of Shu
>**Sanxingdui** is a previously unknown bronze age culture whose artifacts were discovered in 1987 in what is now Sichuan. This culture is now being identified with the ancient kingdom of Shu, c. 316 BCE. These finds **challenge the narrative of Chinese civilization spreading only from the Yellow River/North China plain** and make the case, along with other recent finds, for a view of Chinese culture as having multiple early centers of innovation.
### The Han Dynasty
- The Han Dynasty (206 BCE-220 CE) succeeded the Qin, lasting about four hundred years.
- A rich and powerful state contemporaneous with the Roman Empire, fostering life for common people, appreciation for intellectuals, and flourishing trade, art, and literature.
- Confucianism codified, and imperial examinations established, influencing Chinese culture for the next two millennia.

## Three Kingdoms of Korea and the Tomb Period of Japan

> [!NOTE] Influence from Early Chinese Kingdoms
> The cultural innovations in the early Chinese kingdoms influenced the growth of city culture and organized states on the Korean peninsula and Japan. Writing, philosophies such as Confucianism, government structure, and technological innovations were introduced in a variety of ways to areas that would eventually become the Three Kingdoms in Korea (57 BCE-668 CE) and the cultures of the Tomb Period (300-552 CE) in Japan.

- Three Kingdoms of Korea—Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla—flourished at the end of the 5th century CE.
- Large tomb mounds (tumuli) in both Korea and Japan marked periods of cultural significance.
- Kofun Period in Japan (3rd to 6th century CE) associated with mounded and keyhole-shaped tombs.

- East Asian innovations like the compass, improved rudders, sails, and gunpowder played crucial roles in European adventures.
- European traders from Portugal, Spain, Holland, England, and France engaged in fierce rivalries, exploring and trading on several continents.
- Swifter and cheaper routes to East Asia were sought for access to consumer goods like textiles, spices, porcelain, silk, and tea.
