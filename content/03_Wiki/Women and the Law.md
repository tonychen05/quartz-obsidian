## Feminist Legal Theory

**Feminism** is a framework aimed at social change through a gender-focused lens, addressing how social institutions and laws reflect and perpetuate gender inequalities. Feminist legal theory examines the law from this perspective, arguing that legal systems historically embody patriarchal values—structures dominated by male perspectives and interests.

**Feminist jurisprudent** is the practice of examining and evaluating the law from a feminist perspective

**Patriarchy**, or male dominance at all levels of society, is central to feminist critiques. It describes a system where masculine traits are prized over feminine ones, leading to male superiority and the marginalization of women. In this view, laws often reinforce this dominance, devaluing and oppressing women by reinforcing stereotypes and inequalities.

Within feminist jurisprudence, there are two main debates:

1. **Reformist vs. Radical Feminism**: Reformists advocate for modifying the existing legal system to ensure gender equality, while radicals call for a complete overhaul to remove patriarchal biases entirely.

2. **Sameness vs. Difference**: This debate questions whether women should be treated the same as men or whether the law should account for differences between the sexes. Sameness feminists argue for equal treatment based on the assumption of gender equality, while difference feminists highlight the need to address specific issues arising from gender differences, such as pregnancy-related needs in the workplace.

A compromise suggests that the law should recognize gender differences but focus on addressing the needs and consequences of these differences rather than just the differences themselves. This approach advocates for rights based on needs, ensuring that legal treatment is fair and equitable for all genders.

## Women and Law in History

#### Pre-18th Century
In early Greek society, women's status was mixed. Initially, myths featured powerful female deities, but as male gods gained prominence, female figures were increasingly depicted as sources of misfortune, reinforcing misogynistic views. Women were typically confined to domestic roles, though some, like in Sparta, had more public lives due to social structures focused on breeding. Despite this, most Greek laws and social norms were repressive, limiting women's rights and roles.

In Roman times, Cicero and the Twelve Tables codified the idea of women as subordinate to men, keeping them under male guardianship. This pattern continued into medieval Europe, where women had limited property rights and were largely confined to the home, their roles justified by religious doctrines that emphasized female submission.

During the Renaissance, women were seen as virtuous but still expected to avoid public life, reinforcing domestic roles. This view persisted into the Reformation and Tudor England, where women had minimal rights and were largely excluded from public spheres.

Philosophers like Hobbes and Locke acknowledged some rights for women but still viewed them as inferior. Rousseau, despite advocating equality for men, denied it to women, relegating them to the private sphere.

Mary Wollstonecraft, in the late 18th century, challenged these views in *A Vindication of the Rights of Woman*. She argued that women's intellectual abilities had not been developed due to lack of education and that if women were given equal opportunities for learning and growth, their intellect would match that of men. Wollstonecraft advocated for women's education and equal treatment, emphasizing that women should be recognized for their potential beyond traditional domestic roles.

#### 19th Century Onwards
Throughout the 19th century, inspired by figures like Mary Wollstonecraft, women gradually gained legal rights similar to other marginalized groups. In the United States, voting rights initially expanded to lower-class white males through Jacksonian reforms and to Black males with the Fifteenth Amendment, though practical voting rights for Black men were often obstructed until the 1960s civil rights movement. Despite the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of equal protection, women were largely excluded from these protections.

Before the American Revolution, some colonies allowed unmarried women with property to vote, but most new state constitutions, except New Jersey’s, revoked this right. The New Jersey Constitution was amended in 1807 to rescind women’s suffrage, highlighting the irony of a democracy founded on exclusion.

Common law, influenced by Blackstone's writings, treated married women as legal dependents of their husbands under coverture, stripping them of individual rights. The Founding Fathers largely ignored pleas from women like Abigail Adams for equal rights, and prominent figures such as John Adams and Thomas Jefferson did not support women's suffrage, reinforcing gender inequality.

When Elizabeth Cady Stanton proposed women's suffrage at the 1848 Seneca Falls Convention, it was met with skepticism. Although the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments granted voting rights to Black men, women’s attempts to include gender in these amendments were unsuccessful. Black women, like Sojourner Truth, highlighted the dual challenges of race and gender discrimination but were often sidelined in the suffrage movement.

Despite the national reluctance, some Western states, including Wyoming and Utah, granted women the right to vote in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The struggle for nationwide suffrage culminated in the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment in 1920, granting women the right to vote. This achievement followed decades of relentless activism, as detailed by Carrie Chapman Catt, who emphasized the extensive effort required to secure this right.

The international women's suffrage movement also gained momentum, with early successes in countries like New Zealand and Australia. The formation of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance in 1902 helped coordinate global efforts, eventually influencing suffrage advancements in other countries.

### Women as Human and Person
Historically, women and girls were often viewed as property rather than autonomous individuals in Western and other traditions. This perspective reduced their value to their roles within family structures—wife, daughter, mother, or sister—rather than recognizing them as independent persons. This view led to women being categorized as either revered "Madonnas" if they adhered to traditional roles and behavior, or as despised "whores" if they did not conform, leading to societal rejection and abuse.

Matilda Joslyn Gage, a prominent women's suffrage activist in the 19th century, argued that U.S. law was influenced by church (canon) law, which she believed was designed to subjugate women. She highlighted that women were disproportionately accused of witchcraft, a phenomenon fueled by the belief in women's inherent wickedness and promoted by religious leaders. Gage suggested that the church's interest in witch trials was partly economic, as the execution of accused witches often led to the transfer of their property to the church and its affiliates.

### Rape and Other Misogynous Atrocities
Historically, laws addressing rape and domestic violence have often prioritized male property rights over the well-being of female victims. According to Brownmiller (1975), rape was treated as a violation of a man’s property rather than a crime against the woman herself. The loss of virginity, for instance, was considered damage to a woman's value as property, and compensation was due to her male owner, typically her father or husband.

In ancient legal systems, such as those in Babylon and under Mosaic law, rape was viewed as theft of a daughter’s market value. Non-virgins faced skepticism about their behavior, and legal responses often blamed the victim. For example, under the Code of Hammurabi, a raped married woman could be drowned with her attacker, while ancient Hebrews might stone both parties, presuming the woman's complicity.

Efforts to protect women from abuse within marriage were often resisted, reflecting the notion that men had rights over their wives and daughters as property. Early American common law, for instance, allowed husbands to physically discipline their wives under the "rule of thumb," which permitted beating with a stick no thicker than a thumb. This idea mirrored earlier English common law, where a husband's authority over his wife was akin to the monarch’s over subjects.

Crimes like adultery were harshly penalized for women but not for men, reflecting the view of women as property whose fidelity affected a man’s ownership. Even today, in some parts of the world, such as under fundamentalist Sharia law, rape victims may face severe penalties if they cannot provide required evidence, further highlighting the continued disparity in the treatment of women’s rights and their status as property.

### The UNCEFDW and the Equal Rights Amendment
International standards, such as those outlined in Article 11 of the **United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women** (UNCEFDW) from 1979, have recognized the importance of protecting women's economic and political participation. This Convention, which became an international treaty in 1981, guarantees rights similar to those sought by the **Equal Rights Amendment** (ERA) in the U.S. The ERA, first introduced in 1923, was passed by Congress in 1972 but failed to be ratified by the necessary 38 states and is currently dormant. Efforts to revive the ERA are ongoing, partly inspired by the long-delayed ratification of the Twenty-Seventh Amendment in 1992.

Despite progress in women's rights through legislation and court decisions, these protections can be inconsistent and subject to change. The ERA would enshrine gender equality in the U.S. Constitution, ensuring consistent application of rights and elevating the standard of judicial review to strict scrutiny for gender-related issues. This constitutional guarantee would help American women realize the benefits outlined in the UNCEFDW.

### Domestic Violence
Domestic violence, primarily affecting women, has been legally addressed only in recent decades. This violence includes physical, sexual, and psychological abuse within domestic settings, with intimate partner violence (IPV) being the most common form in the U.S. IPV is predominantly perpetrated by men against women, though women who commit such violence often use weapons to counteract physical differences.

The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) of 1994 marked a significant legal response, providing funding for training and support in handling domestic violence cases. The law introduced measures such as mandatory arrest and no-drop prosecution, initially showing promising results in reducing repeat incidents in some areas. However, the effectiveness varied, with mixed results across different neighborhoods.

Data from 1993 to 2010 shows a more than 60% decline in intimate partner violence, with women remaining the primary victims. The highest rates of IPV are among women aged 18-34, and women living with children experience significantly higher rates of violence compared to other household types.

### Women's Representation in the Legal Profession
The path for women entering the legal profession has been marked by significant struggles and advancements. Historically, women faced substantial barriers to entry and full participation in law, rooted in a broader cultural system that subordinated women. Obstacles included exclusion, hostility, differential assignments, and sexual harassment. Although some women in colonial America engaged in quasi-legal work, like Margaret Brent, most women were systematically barred from formal legal roles until the late 19th century.

Despite early instances of women in legal roles, such as Elizabeth Freeman and Charlotte Ray, women faced systemic exclusion from law clerkships, law schools, and bar exams. The belief that women were unsuited for law due to their perceived emotional nature further impeded their progress. Notable milestones came in the late 1800s with Arabella Babb Mansfield, the first female lawyer, and Myra Bradwell's legal battles for admission. It wasn't until the 20th century that women began making substantial inroads, largely due to feminist advocacy and legislation like Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Title IX of the Higher Education Act of 1972.

By the 1970s and 1980s, women’s numbers in law schools and legal professions increased significantly. The mid-1990s saw women comprising nearly half of law school students, and today, women represent about 37% of active attorneys and 47.5% of associates in major law firms. However, disparities remain, with fewer women in senior roles like partners and judges, partly due to factors such as career interruptions and unconscious bias.

Women’s experiences in the legal field show progress but also ongoing challenges. While women and men share similar values and work satisfaction in many areas, women often face lower job satisfaction due to issues with advancement, recognition, and gender diversity in firms. Continued efforts are needed to address these disparities and ensure full equality in the legal profession.

### The Bias Studies
Gender bias continues to pervade America's courtrooms, affecting both litigants and legal professionals. Studies across various states reveal that women face differential treatment in civil and criminal courts, often encountering bias that makes pursuing justice more challenging. 

In domestic violence cases, many male courtroom personnel believe women's abuse claims are exaggerated, and some judges question what victims did to provoke the abuse. Prosecutors in some jurisdictions may not pursue charges unless the victim insists, despite the state's role as the aggrieved party. Similar biases are evident in sexual assault cases, where victims' credibility is often undermined and their sexual history improperly considered.

Bias is also apparent in family law cases, with some studies showing that men are more likely to receive favorable outcomes in divorce and property disputes. Female attorneys and judges report being less credible than their male counterparts and facing sexist remarks or treatment. Women of color, in particular, encounter higher levels of bias and are often mistaken for administrative staff rather than legal professionals.

Efforts to address this bias must go beyond legal reforms and focus on changing individual attitudes to achieve true gender equality in the legal system. Despite progress, significant challenges remain, and addressing these biases requires ongoing education and awareness.

### Law, Equality, and Justice
Over time, feminist efforts have succeeded in achieving formal legal recognition of women as equal citizens and securing their access to higher education and legal professions. However, ongoing debates among feminist scholars focus on whether true justice for women can be achieved through the current legal system and whether equality with men guarantees justice for women.

The legal system remains male-centered, often reflecting and reinforcing outdated views about women. For instance, rape trials frequently involve the sexualization of women's bodies rather than addressing the assault itself. Legal restrictions, such as those requiring parental consent for abortions or recent severe limitations on abortion access in Texas, further illustrate how the law can control women's bodies.

Carol Gilligan suggests that the law's current framework, which emphasizes competitive and aggressive values, reflects masculine perspectives. She argues that incorporating more feminine values like cooperation and care could lead to greater justice within the legal system. Similarly, Catharine MacKinnon calls for a new jurisprudence that acknowledges and incorporates the female experience and perspective to achieve true equality and protection under the law.

Overall, while significant progress has been made, the law still exhibits biases that disadvantage women. Future reforms should strive to address these biases and ensure that laws genuinely support women's rights and experiences.
