> $f(x,y)$ is differentiable at $(a,b)$ if the graph of $f(x,y)$ looks like a plane as we zoom in on $(a,b,f(a,b))$. We call this plane the **tangent plane** at $(a,b,f(a,b))$

The existence of [[partial derivatives]] at $(a,b)$ was insufficient to determine if $f(x,y)$ is differentiable at $(a,b),$
but when $f(x,y)$ is actually differentiable at $(a,b),$ partials will allow us to **find an equation for the tangent plane**.


> [!INFO] Define: Tangent Plane
> - If $f(x,y)$ is differentiable at $(a,b)$, then there is a tangent plane at $(a,b,f(a,b))$
> - A normal vector for the tangent plane is $$\vec{n}=\left< f_{x}(a,b),f_{y}(a,b),-1 \right>. $$ We can use this and the point $(a,b,f(a,b))$ to write the equation of the plane
