> What is justice? Where does it come from? What is its relationship to the law? Justice is one of the "great intangibles," along with truth, beauty, and love; all recogniziable in their particular manifestation but awkward to define.

The definition of justice in Webster's dictionary is cyclical. Justice is "the maintenance or administration of what is just."

But... what is just?

Webster defines just as "conforming to a standard of correctness; righteous; merited; deserved." But what is correct? right? deserved?

The definition of justice that is perhaps the most widely accepted over the centuries is the one offered by Aristotle 300 years before the birth of Christ:

> [!INFO] Define: Justice (Aristotle)
> "Justice consists of treating equals equally and unequals unequally according to relevant differences"

^b570b6

Similarly, the great Roman Jurist Dometius Ulpanius defined justice as "the constant and perpetual will to allot everyman his due."

Justice is thus about how we behave toward and treat others and how decisions are made about what type of behavior and treatment is appropriate given our perceptions about what others deserve. The equally balanced scales weighing conflicting claims and the sword of retribution are an internationally recognized symbol (“Lady Justice”).

## Aristotle's Definition of Justice

Considering [[Justice and the Law#^b570b6|Aristotle's definition]], let's examine what various legal scholars have considered as the two components of justice with which Aristotle was most concerned: **distributive** justice and **retributive** justice.

### Distributive Justice

> [!INFO] Define: Distributive Justice
> Relates to how a political entity such as a nation-state distributes resources to its members.

If there are no good reasons to distribute resources unequally (mean there are no *relevant differences*), then resources should be equally distributed.

But of there there is a argument that there ARE relevant differences with respect to resource distribution, though there may be arguments as to *how* relevant.

Distributive justice is about rightful, merited, deserved distribution; it is **not about need**. A just distribution depends on the individual's contributions and value to the community.

Aristotle’s view of justice, which focuses on distributing resources based on merit rather than need, contrasts with the Marxist principle of distributing according to need. Aristotle argues that equal distribution regardless of contribution is unjust. For instance, giving all students a C grade, regardless of effort, would demotivate higher achievers and be unfair since grades reflect a combination of talent and effort.

When applied to basic needs like welfare, Aristotle would consider it just to help those who cannot work due to past contributions or unavoidable circumstances. However, he would see supporting someone who chooses not to work as unjust, even if it might be compassionate. This distinction highlights Aristotle's view that justice is not always the same as compassion.

The text also critiques extreme disparities in income, such as CEOs earning vastly more than average workers, and celebrities making more than public servants like police officers. While market economies justify such differences based on scarcity and demand, Aristotle’s justice would question whether these differences reflect merit or exploitation. In this framework, only when wealth is gained through exploitation does it become unjust.

Historically, democratic governments have recognized the unjust nature of wealth inequalities and exploitation, addressing them through reforms like trade unions, regulations, and progressive taxation to bring economies closer to ideals of distributive justice.

### Retributive Justice

> [!INFO] Define: Retributive Justice
> Concerned with *how* a society's system of law goes about determining guilt or innocence (procedural retributive justice) and how it goes about determining the proper (just) punishment (substantive retributive justice) for the guilty.

In this view, just punishment reflects the severity of the crime and relevant differences among offenders. The example of a cardiologist and a laborer receiving identical fines for speeding illustrates the idea that equal punishment might not be just if it does not cause equal hardship to both offenders. A day-fine system, which adjusts fines based on income, is suggested as a fairer method of ensuring equal punishment.

In the context of **distributive justice**, the tax rebates in Idaho raise questions about fairness. The distribution of surplus funds, where wealthier individuals received larger rebates, reflects the contribution-based approach of distributive justice. This model rewards individuals based on their prior tax contributions, aligning with Aristotle’s principle of rewarding people based on merit and effort, rather than need.

Key issues in **punishment and justice** include sentencing disparities, where the wide discretion judges have in sentencing can lead to unequal treatment of offenders. Sentencing guidelines, like Ohio's Felony Sentencing Worksheet (FSW), aim to reduce this disparity by standardizing sentencing based on crime severity and offender characteristics. By averaging the practices of many judges, these guidelines promote consistency and balance, which aligns with Aristotle’s ideal of ensuring that punishment is fair and just for all offenders.

## Problems with Aristotle's Definition of Justice
Aristotle's principle of justice, "treating equals equally and unequals unequally according to relevant differences," encounters a major problem: defining what constitutes a *relevant difference*. 

While Aristotle's approach works well in certain contexts, such as rewarding or punishing individuals based on effort or conduct, it can be misused. 

Historically, characteristics like race, gender, religion, and nationality have been deemed "relevant differences" to justify discrimination, oppression, and even slavery. 

When these ascribed statuses are considered relevant, they create profound injustices. It is suggested that justice will be more fully realized when only *differences of conduct*—such as behavior, actions, or merit—are viewed as relevant, rather than immutable characteristics like race or gender.
### Conflict Theory Critique
Conflict theorists extend this critique, arguing that even if Aristotle’s principle is applied equally, unequal outcomes are still likely under current legal systems. Justice, they argue, can become a commodity accessible primarily to the wealthy. 

For instance, wealthier individuals can afford superior legal representation, which may lead to factually guilty individuals being acquitted or innocent individuals being wrongly convicted due to inadequate defense. 

The system, while procedurally just, may produce substantively unjust outcomes due to economic inequality.
### Positivist Law vs. Natural Law: *[[Antigone]]*
In the Greek tragedy **[[Antigone]]** written by Sophocles around 441 BCE , the tension between **natural law** and **positivist law** is illustrated. Antigone represents natural law, which is based on a higher moral order or unwritten principles that she believes supersede human-made laws. She defies King Creon’s positivist law—a set of written, codified rules that govern the state—because she feels a duty to the gods and her family.

Creon, on the other hand, upholds positivist law, believing that maintaining order and following the laws of the state are paramount, even when those laws conflict with personal or moral beliefs. Both sides reflect valid concerns: Antigone's natural law prioritizes moral duties and human compassion, while Creon’s positivist law emphasizes order and the stability of society.

The conflict in *[[Antigone]]* demonstrates that tensions between natural and positivist law are inherent in justice systems. There are situations where laws may conflict with individual moral beliefs or universal principles of justice, raising the question of when it is just to disobey an unjust law. Creon's tragedy serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of rigidly adhering to written laws without considering moral implications, while Antigone’s fate highlights the cost of defying legal authority in pursuit of a higher moral cause.

Ultimately, these discussions raise fundamental questions about justice: How do we determine what differences are relevant when distributing justice? Should legal systems focus solely on the written law, or should they also consider moral and natural principles? The examples of Aristotle’s justice, conflict theory, and the case of Antigone illustrate the complexity and nuance required when balancing fairness, equality, and morality in any society.

## Relationship of Law to Justice
When most people think of justice, they probably think of law, but law and justice are not identical. 

In fact, law professors often get a bit testy if someone mentions justice, and it is difficult to find the term even indexed in most law books. 

Law can be in accordance with justice, but it can also be the furthest thing from it (e. g., Hitler’s Nuremburg Laws). 

Law is in accordance with justice when it respects, cultivates, and protects the dignity of every person living under it; law violates justice when it does not. Believers in natural law maintain that the goal of positive law should be to bring itself into conformity with what is just. 

We have to be confident that we can find justice and that we can harness it and put it to practical use for the benefit of humankind, just as scientists seek to harness the laws of nature and put them to practical use. After all, it is only through law that justice can be achieved.

### Equity
Equity, derived from the Latin term for "just," addresses legal remedies not covered by English common law, serving as a bridge between justice and law. It highlights how legal systems evolve to better reflect moral standards. 

In medieval England, the rigid and inflexible common law led to a growing demand for more adaptable and fair legal remedies. This demand resulted in the creation of the Courts of Chancery, an independent judicial system established to provide relief in cases where common law was insufficient or unjust.

The role of the king’s chancellor, who handled petitions for relief from common law decisions, was pivotal in the development of equity. By the 13th century, the rigid application of common law principles led to numerous petitions for relief, prompting the formation of these courts. 

Judges in the Courts of Chancery were instructed to approach cases with flexibility and empathy, focusing on principles of fairness rather than strict adherence to rules.

Equity did not replace common law but complemented it by addressing gaps and inflexibilities. The integration of equity and common law over time led to improvements in both systems: common law became more adaptable and equitable, while equity began to incorporate rational principles and precedent. The formal distinction between the two systems was abolished in 1875, although separate courts for law and equity still exist in some jurisdictions, such as Delaware in the United States.

### An Example of an Equity Decision
An equity decision is a judicial ruling that aims to achieve fairness and justice in cases where rigid application of the law would lead to an unjust result. Equity decisions often address gaps or inflexibilities in the law, providing remedies that are not available under strict legal rules. Historically, equity has been crucial in areas where common law was too rigid or inadequate to address all situations justly.

One notable example of an equity decision is the case of *Riggs v. Palmer* (1889). In this case, Elmer Palmer poisoned his grandfather, Francis Palmer, to inherit his estate. Although Elmer was convicted of murder, the will, which had not been altered, named him as the primary beneficiary. The New York Court of Appeals faced a dilemma: the law required the will to be upheld, but allowing Elmer to profit from his crime would contravene principles of justice. The majority of the court ruled against Elmer, deciding that it would be unjust for him to benefit from his criminal act. This decision illustrated how equity can override strict legal rules to serve a higher principle of fairness.

During the 19th century in the United States, civil law focused primarily on upholding contracts and did not address issues like defective products or unsafe working conditions. This rigid application of law often resulted in unjust outcomes, as legal principles did not account for the welfare of individuals affected by such issues. However, as equity considerations grew in importance, laws evolved to protect consumers and workers, moving beyond the strict legal doctrines of the time.

The case of *Riggs v. Palmer* also highlights a significant tension between legal positivism and equity. Legal positivists argue that judges should adhere strictly to the law, while equity advocates emphasize justice and fairness, even if it means deviating from established rules. Over time, the principles established in equity cases like *Riggs* have influenced legal reforms, and many states now have laws preventing individuals from profiting from their crimes, reflecting an integration of equity principles into formal legal systems.

## Garofalo and Natural Crime
Raffaele Garofalo, an Italian criminologist and legal scholar, sought to provide a "natural" definition of crime, which diverged from the positivistic view that crime is simply what the law defines it to be. Garofalo was dissatisfied with the arbitrary nature of legal definitions and sought a more scientific approach that grounded crime in human nature.

Garofalo’s approach was to anchor the definition of crime in universal human sentiments. He proposed that an act should only be considered a crime if it was universally condemned, meaning that it offends natural sentiments of probity (integrity and honesty) and pity (compassion and sympathy). This aligns with the evolutionary perspective that suggests certain emotional responses to wrongdoing are innate and universal.

In Garofalo’s framework, crimes are classified into two categories:
1. **Mala in se (evil in itself)**: These are crimes that are intrinsically immoral and universally condemned, such as murder, rape, and theft. No one, except in the most unusual circumstances, desires to be a victim of these acts.
2. **Mala prohibita (wrong because prohibited)**: These are crimes that are not universally condemned but are defined as crimes by law, such as prostitution, drug usage, and gambling. These acts are often sought by individuals and do not inherently invoke moral outrage or victimization.

Garofalo’s distinction highlights the notion that laws criminalizing certain behaviors, which may not be universally condemned, can lead to negative consequences like organized crime and corruption. His arguments suggest that legal systems should be mindful of differentiating between crimes that are inherently wrong and those that are deemed illegal by societal norms or laws, reflecting a more nuanced understanding of justice and morality.
