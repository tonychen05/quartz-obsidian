How sentences and phrases are constructed out of smaller phrases and words

### Grammaticality
Grammatical expressions are syntactically well-formed; ungrammatical ones are syntactically ill-formed.

## Syntactic Properties
Syntactic properties determine how we combine lexical expressions to form sentences.
1. **Word Order**
   - Determines the permissible order of expressions within a sentence.
   - Examines the arrangement of words relative to each other.
2. **Co-occurrence**
   - Focuses on which expressions can or must occur together in a sentence.
   - Explores the relationships between different types of expressions within a sentence.
### Word Order
**Misleading labels** - languages can have different word orders in different contexts
#### Common Word Order Patterns
1. **SVO (Subject-Verb-Object)**
   - Example: "Sally walked."
   - Predominant in about 40% of languages.

2. **SOV (Subject-Object-Verb)**
   - Example: "Manasalambaaminâ€™nysavonynylehilahy."
   - Common in about 43% of languages.

3. **VSO (Verb-Subject-Object)**
   - Example: "Ate Sally an apple."
   - Found in about 10% of languages.
#### Variability and Contextual Influence
- Languages often exhibit varied word order patterns in different contexts.
- Example: German's SVO in main clauses vs. SOV in subordinate clauses.
#### Beyond Word Order
- Syntactic constraints extend beyond mere word order.
- Examples:
  - Positional requirements for determiners (e.g., "these books" vs. "*books these").
  - Constraints on prepositions in relation to noun phrases (e.g., "met with that person" vs. "*met that person with").
  - Distinctions between prepositions and postpositions, as seen in Japanese.
### Co-occurrence
The set of syntactic properties that determines which expressions **may or have to co-occur** with some other expressions in a sentence.

#### Arguments
When an expression requires another expression, the required expression is an **argument**
Example: In "Sally devoured an apple," both "Sally" and "an apple" are arguments of "devoured."

**Complement:** are non-subject argument
#### Adjuncts 
- Unlike arguments, adjuncts are optional expressions in a sentence.
- Adjuncts provide additional information but are not necessary for grammaticality.
- For instance, "to study French" is an adjunct in "Sally went to France to study French" but an argument in "Sally urged Bob to study French."
#### Agreement
 - Expressions may require agreement in terms of morphological features such as number, person, and gender.
- For example, verbs in English show agreement with their subjects in number ("likes" with singular subjects, "like" with plural subjects).

Morphological features influence syntactic properties, leading to tight interactions between morphology and syntax referred to jointly as **morphosyntax**.
