Often regarded as a compliment to [[Confucianism]], Daoism (Taoism) developed early in Chinese history. The term “Daoism” is based on the Chinese word meaning “way” (_dao_) or “path.” This “way” is regarded as a cosmic force that permeates and underlies all phenomena.

The goal of Daoism is to attune one’s self with the Way, an attunement that is realized by the principle of “no action” (wuwei). 

By opening one’s self to the natural flow of the Way, one can achieve all, yet do so without creating strife and discord. 
	A major metaphor in Daoist thinking is that of water. Water may seem weak and yielding, yet it is that characteristic of yielding that gives it its power.

# Yin and Ying

- **Yin** = soft, gentle, passive, dark, intuitive, “female”
