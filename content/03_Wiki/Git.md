# Workflow
### Repositories
A folder that contains related items, such as files, images, videos, or even other folders.

#### README
README files contain information about your project and are written in Markdown

### Branch
Branching allows for different versions of a repository at one time.

Branching is helpful when you want to add new features to a project without changing the main source of code.

When you create a branch off the `main` branch, you make a snapshot of `main` ad it was.
