In February 1932, future British Prime Minister Winston Churchill was knocked down by a cab as he crossed Fifth Avenue in New York. Churchill had a flask of whiskey on his person which was prohibted due to the 1919 National Prohibition Act to enforce the Eighteenth Amendment’s prohibition of the manufacture, sale, or importation of alcoholic beverages. 

Temperance and abstinence movements had existed for decades before this based on the fact that unbridled drinking was the cause of many of society’s problems, particularly crime. In passing the act, lawmakers were responding to demands for change in an important area of social life. Activists of all persuasions agitate for change, and sometimes lawmakers put their stamp of approval on their goals by passing acts and making favorable judicial decisions.

The intention, of course, was to severely limit drinking and thus to limit the evils associated with it. Unfortunately, good intentions often have unintended consequences that few people see beforehand. What the US Congress did in 1919 was give every petty criminal gang in the country a green light to unlimited expansion and riches. In many ways, it literally kick-started organized crime in the United States and ushered in a decade of gang wars and widespread corruption. Prohibiting alcohol made it more exciting to imbibe it in the speakeasies that sprang up everywhere. In a number of cases, people were poisoned by bad liquor, and there was apparently no letup in incidents of spousal or child abuse.

These are some of the questions to keep in mind as we examine the role of law in social change.

## What is Social Change?

> [!INFO] Define: Social Change
> any relatively enduring alteration in social relationships, behavior patterns, values, norms, and attitudes occurring over time

Some changes may seem trivial, but they may aggregate and interact with other trivial as well as nontrivial changes to produce patterns of behavior and values that can appear grotesquely alien to individuals born in an earlier period. 

Because of the sheer complexity of modern societies and the intricate interaction of their component parts, each small change generates its own momentum, gathering speed in a chain reaction as each change generates even more change. The sheer pace of modern social change can leave some of us giddy and confused, alienated and afraid.

There was a time when people lived out their lives without a hint of social change as norms, customs, values, and practices generally lasted from an individual's birth to death.

This is because there was less forms of communication back then and as a consequence, less spread of ideas. Small and isolated cultures are like small and isolated gene pools—they tend toward equilibrium.

Ideas are "inbred" and produce only small mutations from the standard ideas available; there are only so many [[permutations|permutations]] possible from a limited pool of either genes or ideas.

For much of human history, large-scale social change happened outside the culture and in the form of wars, invasions, famines, pestilence, and changes in climate but rarely from within the culture itself.

The comfort of habit is one of the reasons that many people resist change, even if it may be desirable on moral grounds, and occasionally enlist the law in their endeavors to do so.

Those who strongly resist social change are usually those who profit most from society as it exists or who feel most psychologically threatened by change. Changes such as the emergence of legalized pornography and abortion in the 1970s may be resisted because “it’s just not right”, meaning that the change is perceived as being at odds with traditional values. 

Tensions occur when the pressures of change collide with established norms, and these tensions occasionally lead to the emergence of prejudice and intolerance. Most social changes, however, tend to work themselves out without serious conflict, and most changes that do generate conflict usually are resolved in courts of law in modern societies.

## The Law as a Cause of Social Change

Historically, the law has played only a minor role in social change compared to other causes, but its role has increased hugely over the past two centuries.

This is because the law is mostly *reactive*, rather than proactive in social change; it reacts to social forces rather than sets such forces in motion.

However, the law does sometimes, being an independent source of power, function as the instrument of social change.

Law is often seen as a barrier to change because it codifies norms and customs, which resist change.

Conservative British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli the tension between laws rooted in tradition and laws rooted in abstract principles:

> [!QUOTE] Laws and Traditions versus Abstract Principles
> Change is inevitable in a progressive country. Change is constant; and the great question is, not whether you still resist change which is inevitable, but whether that change shall be carried out in deference to the manners, the customs, the laws and the traditions of a people, or…in deference to abstract principles and arbitrary and general doctrines. - Benjamin Disraeli, speech in Edinburgh, 29 October 1867

To highlight this point, contrast the French (1789) and Russian (1917) Revolutions with the English (1688) and American (1776) Revolutions. The French and Russian Revolutions, driven by abstract ideals, led to chaos and despotism, while the English and American Revolutions aimed to restore order by respecting customs and laws, resulting in balanced governance.

When law no longer aligns with societal customs, it signals cultural and **social fracture**. Conservatives argue that law should be an organic extension of custom and moral sentiment, not a tool for utopian social engineering. They advocate for law to fix specific issues, not pursue unrealistic ideals, often calling for a return to traditional values, which in a diverse society like the U.S., is seen as a return to white, Christian, Anglo-Saxon norms. This perspective is controversial because many Americans, particularly minorities, were never part of these traditions.

This should not be construed as a condemnation of the mainstream cultural traditions of the United States. They are still laudable and meaningful, and they have produced a wealthy and decent society where rights and liberty are honored more than in the vast majority of nations around the world.

The mainstream American cultural tradition, while valuable, does not reflect the diverse backgrounds of many citizens. In this diverse society, law must be fair to all groups, not just the dominant one. Many non-European Americans view law as a tool for reform and justice, not the preservation of outdated customs. The challenge for the law is to balance its Anglo-American moral roots with the demands for justice and cultural pluralism, ensuring that it serves all groups, not just the majority.

## Social Movements and the Law

There is a reciprocal relationship between law and social change. Social conditions can give rise to changes in the law, and changes in the law can give rise to changes in social conditions.

In the U.S., law is deeply intertwined with culture and society, often acting as a facilitator of change rather than its cause.

Social movements, driven by groups seeking justice and rights, often use law as a tool to legitimize their claims, and the legal system provides a critical platform for advancing these movements.

Charles Tilly defines a social movement as sustained interactions between marginalized groups and powerholders, aiming to redistribute power. 

Social movements often frame their grievances around rights deprivation, which mobilizes individuals and creates a shared identity. However, movements must also use extralegal tactics like protests and media campaigns to amplify their demands and push for legal recognition.

Democratic societies promote social movements by allowing dissent, and democracy itself fosters the rise of these movements. Historically, social movements have grown stronger as information-sharing, an independent judiciary, and free press emerged, reducing the need for violence to achieve change. For instance, early reforms in the U.S. were ignored until they culminated in the American Revolution.

The "contagion effect" occurs when the success of one social movement inspires other groups to pursue their own rights claims. The U.S. Supreme Court was particularly responsive to such claims between 1953 and 1986, during which many reforms for minorities, women, and LGBTQ individuals were achieved. Law plays a dual role in this process: it can either facilitate or block social change, but ultimately, it legitimizes and smooths the path for progress.

## British Law and American Revolution

Anyone reluctant to credit the law with much of a role in social change might ponder the possibility that were it not for a number of British legal decisions in the eighteenth century, the American colonies may have remained loyal to the mother country.

Several British laws imposed on the American colonies after the French and Indian Wars, like the Mutiny Act, Sugar Act, and Stamp Act, led to colonial opposition, often using British law to resist these impositions. The Proclamation Act of 1763, which restricted settlement west of the Appalachians, angered land speculators like George Washington and Benjamin Franklin, pushing them toward favoring independence.

Two important judicial rulings in Britain, _Somerset v. Stewart_ (1772) and _Joseph Knight v. Wedderburn_ (1778), both involving the abolition of slavery, may have further contributed to the colonies' desire for independence, especially in the South, where slavery was vital to the economy. These rulings threatened to challenge slavery throughout the British Empire, which was unacceptable to southern colonists.

The American Revolution was framed as a legal dispute rather than an ideological one, with colonists asserting their rights under British constitutional principles. The Declaration of Independence was viewed by revolutionaries as a legal separation, rooted in the Glorious Revolution of 1688, which established the sovereignty of the law over the monarchy. The offenses listed against George III in the Declaration were violations of British legal traditions, and the colonists saw their rebellion as upholding the legal precedents of their forefathers.

## Law and Social Engineering in the Former Soviet Union
The history of the Soviet Union provides a contrasting example to the United States regarding the role of law in social change. While czarist Russia used law to stifle change, leading to its collapse, the Soviet Union used law as a tool to force social transformation. 

The Soviets, unlike the U.S., did not use their constitutions to establish enduring legal principles but as political tools, frequently changing them to serve the Communist Party's interests. Soviet constitutions helped legalize the political order, regulate behavior, and outline national goals, but rights were not protected by strong legal institutions, only by the power of the president.

Under the Soviet regime, law was a vehicle for enforcing Marxist ideology, often used arbitrarily through vague legal concepts like “counter-revolutionary” to serve the state's needs. The Soviets attempted to legislate morality, including drastic family law reforms aimed at undermining the "bourgeois family" by promoting divorce, free love, and cohabitation. These changes, however, led to social chaos, with a surge in fatherless children and crime, prompting the government to reverse these policies and promote traditional family values.

This experience shows both the potential and limitations of law in driving social change. While law can be used to enforce large-scale change, such efforts are more sustainable when supported by societal customs rather than pure coercion. Even in totalitarian systems like the Soviet Union, law is both a leader and follower of social change, and drastic reforms without legitimacy are often unsustainable.
