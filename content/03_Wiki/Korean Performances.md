## Performance Traditions in Korea
Korea boasts a diverse array of performance traditions, deeply influenced by native shaman rituals, popular Buddhism, and Chinese imperial culture. These traditions include:

1. **Farmer's Music (Nongak)**: A vibrant form of traditional music and dance performed by farmers, often featuring percussion instruments and energetic choreography.
2. **Folk Dances**: Various folk dances showcase regional customs and cultural heritage, often incorporating elements of storytelling and celebration.
3. **Drama (Talchum)**: Talchum is a form of masked dance-drama characterized by colorful costumes, expressive masks, and lively movements. It often features humorous and satirical themes.
4. **Acrobatics**: Traditional Korean acrobatics involve impressive feats of agility, strength, and balance, often performed in colorful costumes and accompanied by music.
5. **Storytelling (Pansori)**: Pansori is a traditional form of narrative singing accompanied by a drummer. Performers tell epic tales through song, combining vocal expression with rhythmic percussion.

Historically, professional performers in Korea occupied a low social status, often coming from families with performance backgrounds. They performed for the royal court and local officials, with certain performances held as part of rituals to invoke blessings and ward off misfortune.

During the Joseon (Yi) dynasty, many of Korea's traditional performance styles were developed. However, by the early 20th century, these traditions faced challenges due to colonization, industrialization, and war. Efforts to revitalize traditional forms began in the late 1960s, with some performers recognized as "national treasures."

One notable modern revival is **Samulnori**, a percussion ensemble that revitalized Korean farmer's music into an exciting new performance tradition. Samulnori has gained widespread appeal and recognition.

While government sponsorship has supported traditional performance forms in South Korea, performance in North Korea often has political significance, with information on these practices also being examined where applicable.


**Social Status of Performers**: Traditionally, performers in Korea held low social status, with professional storytellers (kwangdae) often entertaining the royal court and government officials.

**Development during Joseon Dynasty**: Many performance styles in Korea, including Salpuri dance, Talchum (masked drama), Nong-ak (farmers' dances), and Pansori (one-man opera), were developed during the Joseon (Choson) dynasty.
