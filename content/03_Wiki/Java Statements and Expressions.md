# Statement
A **statement** is a "smallest complete unit of execution" (roughly analogous to "sentence")

A simple statement is terminated with a semi-colon `;`


> [!EXAMPLE]
> `i = 12;`
> `j += 7;`
> `k++;`
> `SimpleWriter fileOut = new SimpleWriter1L("foo.txt");`
> `fileOut.print("Hi, Mr. Foo.");`

# Expression
An **expression** is a "syntactically well-formed and meaningful fragment." (roughly analogous to "word")

A piece of code that resolves to a value.

> [!EXAMPLE]
> `i`
> `j + 7`
> `"Hello" + " World"`
> `keyboard.nextLine()`
> `n==0`
> `new SimpleWriter1L()`
