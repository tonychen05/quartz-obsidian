> [!NOTE] Define: Principle of Compositionality
> Meaning of a sentence relies on the meanings of its constituent words and their syntactic arrangement.
> - Enables understanding of an infinite number of sentences based on lexical meanings and syntax.
> - Facilitates productivity in language.

Meanings of phrases depend on the meanings of the words they contain.
    - Example: "Sally loves Polly" vs. "Polly loves Sally" demonstrates different propositions despite identical words, highlighting the importance of **syntactic structure**.


**Problems**:
Idiomatic expressions like "kick the bucket" have non-compositional meanings not predictable from individual word meanings and syntax.
