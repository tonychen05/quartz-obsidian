> [!INFO] Define: Semantics
> Semantics is a subfield of linguistics that studies linguistic meaning and how expressions convey meanings. It deals with the nature of meaning itself—what exactly are linguistic meanings, and what is their relationship to the language user on the one hand and the external world on the other? Semanticists study not only word meanings, but also how word meanings combine to produce the meanings of larger phrasal expressions. Finally, an important part of the study of meaning in natural language involves meaning relationships between expressions

Language has a finite number of words, a speaker can't memorize all the possible number of sentence meanings

Speakers use the **meaning** of the pieces of the sentence to figure out the meanings of the whole thing

> [!NOTE] Two aspects of meaning
> - **Sense:**
> 	- Mental representation or concept of an expression's meaning.
> 	- Includes associated images, thoughts, and related information.
> 	- Knowing sense entails understanding of expression's meaning.
> - **Reference:**
> 	- Relationship of expression to the world.
> 	- Identifies entities in the world referred to by the expression.
> 	- Understanding reference involves identifying expression's referents.
> 		- *Referents*: entities in the world that refer to the expression (puppy)
> 		- *Reference*: the collect of all the referents of an expression (dogs)

You may know the sense of something but there are no referents
	- **Examples:**
	    - **Unicorn:**
			- Sense: Mental image of mythical creature.
			- Reference: No real-world entity corresponds.
		- **Queen of the United States:**
			- Sense: Conceptual understanding.
			- Reference: No real-world referent.

## Senses: Sources of Meaning
**Dictionary Source**
	Entries are not fixed, can change over time
	Models word usage rather than dictating it
	New words or definitions aren't introduced solely by dictionary entries; slang
*DOESNT WORK; entries are dynamic*

**Mental Image Definition**
	Everyone has different mental images
	Mental image can't really work for all words ("The")
*DOESNT WORK; is unreliable and varies person to person*

**Usage-based Definition**
	"A large, soft piece of material draped across a bed for the purpose of keeping people warm while they sleep" = "a blanket"
	If we know what a word means, then we know under what conditions it is appropriate to be used
*DOESN'T WORK; required to understand the context of the word*

> [!NOTE] Conclusion: Sources of Meaning
>  - Defining the sense of a word is challenging.
>  - Sense may involve a mental concept, yet specifics remain unclear.
>  - Knowledge of usage conditions essential for understanding word meanings.

## References
**Proper Names**
- Refer to specific entities:
	- e.g., "China" refers to the country, "Barack Obama" refers to the individual.
- Directly denote particular individuals or places.

**Common Nouns**

# Semantic Change
A change in the set of referents for a word ("a change in meaning")

### Semantic Extension
when the set of appropriate contexts or referents for a word increase

ex: google, nuke, bird, zerox, Brutus, etc.

### Semantic Reduction:
when the set of appropriate contexts or referents for a word decreases

ex: worm, wife, meat
ex: girl
	early meaning – ‘child, young person’
	current meaning – ‘female child or young women’

### Semantic Elevation:
when a word takes on a more positive connotation over time

ex: nice, knight

### Semantic Degradation:
when a word acquires a more negative connotation over time

ex: accident, silly
