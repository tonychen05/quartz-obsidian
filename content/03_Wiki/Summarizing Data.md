The discipline of **statistics** provides methods for **organizing and summarizing data** and for **drawing conclusions** based on information contained in the data.

> [!INFO] Define: data
> collections of facts


An investigation will focus on a well-defined collection of objects constituting a **population** of interest.

Examples of populations are:
- all gelatin capsules of a particular type produced during a specified period
- all individuals who received a B.S. in engineering during the most recent academic year

There are two types of populations: **tangible** and **conceptual**.
- Tangible: finite, and population size is decreased by 1 each time an object is chosen
	- Ex: American voters, circuit boards at a manufacturing plant
- Conceptual: a possibly infinite set of all possible outcomes of a process if it were to be repeated indefinitely under identical conditions
	- Ex: temperature reading of Covid patients,

When desired information is available for all objects in the population, we have a **census** where we sample all members of a population which makes the data very **accurate**. But, predictably, having all the information for a population is **infeasible** due to time, money, and other scare resources.

Thus, we turn to **samples**, a *subset* of the population. We might obtain a sample of bearings from a particular production run as a basis for investigating whether beards are conforming to specifications or we might select a sample of last year's engineering graduates to obtain feedback about the quality of the engineering curricula.

We are usually interested only in certain characteristics objects in a population. A **variable** is any characteristic whose value may change from one object to another in the population.

There are two types of variables: **numerical (quantitative)** and **categorical (qualitative)**
- Quantitative: height, weight, IQ, temperature, pressure, density
- Qualitative: defective or not defective, gender, ethnicity

Data results from making observations either on a single variable or simultaneous on two or more variables.

> [!INFO] Define: univariate
> A **univariate** data set consists of observations on a single variable.

For example, the following sample of pulse rates (bpm) for patients recently admitted to an adult intensive care unit:
	`88, 80, 71, 103, 154, 132, 67, 110, 60, 105`

> [!INFO] Define: bivariate
> We have **bivariate** data when observations are made on each of two variables.

For example, data may consist of a (height, weight) pair for each basketball player on a team:
	`(72, 168), (75, 212), . . .`

> [!INFO] Define: multivariate
> **Multivariate** data arises when observations are made on more than one variable (bivariate is a special case of multivariate)

For example, a research physician might determine the systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and serum cholesterol level for each patient participating in a study:
	`(120, 80, 146)`
