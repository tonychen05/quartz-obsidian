## Subclass and Superclass

In Java, it is possible to inherit attributes and methods from one class to another. We group the "inheritance concept" into two categories:

- **subclass** (child) - the class that inherits from another class
- **superclass** (parent) - the class being inherited from 
	- `super()`
```java
public JFrameApp() {
//calls the JFrame (superclass) constructor with a String parameter to name the window in its title bar
	super("Simple GUI");
}
```
- **base class** - type of class that acts as a template or guide for additional classes

To inherit from a class, use the `extends` keyword.
