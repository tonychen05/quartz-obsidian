### ETHNIC DIVERSITY OVERVIEW
- China, with a population exceeding 1.4 billion, is the most populous nation.
- A history of 5,000 years with border expansions, contractions, and massive migrations has led to vast and complex cultural diversity.
- Dozens (even hundreds) of ethnic groups in China, making it the **most diverse country in East Asia**.
- Not always apparent in major cities, ethnic diversity becomes evident in trips between regions and border areas.

### CHINA'S ETHNIC CATEGORIES
- Chinese citizens have identity cards with an "ethnic identity" section.
- Ethnicity in the People’s Republic of China is based on: 
	- common history
	- language
	- area of inhabitation
	- customs
	- livelihood
- Two major ethnic categories: Han ethnic group **(over 91% of the population)** and 55 ethnic minority groups (around 8% of the population).
- All Chinese citizens are considered part of the Zhonghua minzu (民族), or "Chinese people."

### THE HAN ETHNIC GROUP OF CHINA
- Named after the ancient Han dynasty, the Han ethnic group absorbed as many as 2,000 local ethnic groups.
- Major subgroups among the Han, with notable differences between North and South China.
- Language differences among Han subgroups, contributing to regional diversity.
- Local variations in daily life customs, food, kinship systems, marriage rituals, religious expression, and more.

### THE ETHNIC MINORITIES OF CHINA
- Besides the Han, Chinese citizens are categorized as "ethnic minorities."
- Historical handling of ethnic differences, including tribute agreements and exchanges of brides.
- Recognition of five ethnic groups during the early 20th century; the People’s Republic of China flag symbolism.
- 55 recognized ethnic minorities range from millions to a few thousand members.
- Ethnic minority peoples mainly inhabit China’s borderlands, engaging in herding, upland agriculture, handicrafts, and ethnic tourism.
- Many subgroups within larger ethnic minorities, each with distinct names, customs, folklore, and language dialects.

### POLITICAL ENTITIES AND SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
- Most ethnic minorities live in specially designated "**autonomous areas**" (townships, counties, prefectures, autonomous regions).
	- 5 "Autonomous Areas” 
		- Xizang Tibetan Autonomous Region
		- Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region
		- Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region
		- Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region
		- Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region
- Representation of minorities in local government, with varying degrees of autonomy.

### PROMISE AND PROBLEMS
- Improvement in minority policies since the late 1970s, with increased participation in modern urban life.
- Economic advances in ethnic minority areas, though environmental challenges like desertification and pollution.
- Ethnic tensions in some regions, particularly in the west, with controversial anti-terrorism measures in Xinjiang.
- Poverty elimination campaigns targeting minority areas and increased representation in higher education for minority groups.
- Clashes between China's rising superpower status and environmental issues affecting traditional local cultures.
