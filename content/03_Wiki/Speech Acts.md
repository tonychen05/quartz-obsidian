## Common Speech Acts:
- **Assertion**: Conveys information.
- **Question**: Elicits information.
- **Request**: Elicits action or information (more or less politely).
- **Order**: Demands action.
- **Promise**: Commits the speaker to an action.
- **Threat**: Commits the speaker to an action that the hearer does not want.

## Felicity Conditions
To be [[Pragmatics#Felicity|felicitous]], SAs (speech acts) must be uttered in a certain kind of context
- For a request to be felicitous, it must be directed to a person (or animal or machine) that is capable of doing whatever action was requested
- Any speech act has a set of conditions that must hold for that speech act to be felicitous

## Performatives
**Performative SA**: the speech act we are performing is denoted by the verb itself

In other words, when someone makes a performative statement, they're not just describing an action; they're actually performing that action.

For example, saying "I promise to help you" isn't just describing the act of promising to help someone; it's actually making the promise itself. Similarly, saying "I apologize for my mistake" isn't just talking about apologizing; it's an actual apology.

Performative speech acts often involve verbs like promise, apologize, congratulate, declare, order, and so on. These verbs don't just describe actions; they perform those actions when used in certain contexts.

**Example**:
Someone can say "I am throwing a ball" without a ball actually being thrown
*BUT*
Someone cannot normally say "I promise to take you to the store later" without actually making such a promise

**Performative verbs therefore denote purely linguistic actions.**

#### Requirements for Performatives:
- The subject of the sentence must be first-person ('I' or 'we')
	- since these speech acts concern the interaction between speakers and hearers
- The verb must be in present tense
	- since performative speech acts, like all actions, take place in the present

## Indirect SAs
**Direct SAs** perform their functions in a direct and literal manner.
**Indirect SAs** - a SA by way of performing another
- what a speaker actually means is difference from what they literally say.

*Direct*: 
- Did John marry Helen?

*Indirect*:
- I don't know if John married Helen.
- I would like to know if John married Helen.
