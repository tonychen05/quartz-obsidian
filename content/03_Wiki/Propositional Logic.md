Propositional logic is a branch of mathematical logic that studies propositions (very old, Aristotle times, modern by Boole).

> [!INFO] Define: Proposition
> A declarative statement or sentence with a truth value (either true or false, not both, not neither)

As a general rule to identify propositions, prefix the statement with "it is the case that..."

For example, the statement "$2+2=4$" is a proposition.
	The statement "$\sqrt{ 2 }$" is not a proposition; it does not make sense to say: "It is the case that $\sqrt{ 2 }$."

We need not know the "correct" truth value in order for a statement to be a proposition.
	The statement "there are infinitely many pairs of primes that are two apart" is a proposition even if we don't know if the statement is true or false. This particular problem is known as the twin prime conjecture.

Given a set of propositions, we can use [[Logical Connectives]] to create new propositions from them called **compound** propositions.  

A proposition is **atomic** if it cannot be obtained as a result of using logical connectives to combine other prepositions in the sense that its truth value is not dependent on the truth values of another proposition. Intuitively, these are the "smallest" propositions.
