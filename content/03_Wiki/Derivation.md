> [!INFO] Definition: Derivation
> Derivation involves creating new words from existing ones, often changing lexical categories.

When the resulting new word is not of a different lexical category, the meaning of the root word is usually changed.

For example, while *playable* is an adjective derived from the verb *play*, *replay* is a verb derived from a verb, and *unkind* is an adjective derived from an adjective *kind*, but with altered meanings.
### Parts:
- **Root**: Basic unit to create words
- **Affix**: pieces added to the stem
	- prefixes, suffixes, etc.
- **Stem**: the base of the word, sometimes root, sometimes root + affix

In derivation, affixes attach to stems, altering meaning or category.


> [!WARNING] Derivation is NOT to be mistaken with [[Inflection]]
> *Cat* vs *cats* is not derivation because the meaning is not changed nor is the lexical category (nouns)
