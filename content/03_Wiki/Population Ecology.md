> [!INFO] Define: population
> A population includes all the organisms that belong to the same species that are living within a designated area and can interact, breed, and have offspring.

**Population ecology** is the study of these *populations*.

Population ecologists study different species around the world for many important reasons including:
- Determining which species need protection, such as endangered species
- Managing economically valuable species, such as commercial fisheries
- Controlling pest species and invasive species

> [!NOTE] Hierarchy of Life on Earth

## Population Distribution

> [!INFO] Define: Range
> the geographic area where a species can be found

Factors such as time of year, breeding activity, where a species historically originated can all determine its range. A range map shows the distribution and boundary lines of a population.

> [!INFO] Define: Population Distribution
> spacing and location of individuals within their range

Both behavioral and ecological factors can influence a population distribution. Understanding a population's distribution is essential for healthy population management.

There are three broad population distribution patterns:
- Clumped
	- Organisms are *grouped* together in clusters
	- Found in environments with unevenly distributed resources
	- May be clustered due to social factors, such as family groups
	- May also group together to hunt more effectively or to protect themselves from predators
	- Examples are sardines and humans
- Random
	- Organisms are *randomly spaced*
	- Occurs when organisms of a species are in environments where the position of each individal is independent of all other individuals
	- Often a lack of social interaction within the species
	- More likely to occur where environmental conditions are consistent
	- Examples are dandelions
- Uniform
	- Organisms are *evenly spaced* from one another
	- Found in populations where the distance between organisms is maximized
	- Spacing is often a result of competition
	- Farming and agricultural practices showcase man made uniform distribution

### Factors Affecting Species Distribution
**Abiotic Factors**:
- climatic factors (precipitation, sunlight, humidity, sunlight, temperature, pH)
	- geographical range of plant and animal species are limited by climatic factors like temperature and precipitation
	- the magnitude and variability of climatic changes limits an organism's ability to survive and produce offspring
	- species can respond to changing climate by migrating to new areas, for example, move to cooler locations at higher latitudes
	- climate changes are difficult to predict, and scientists use computer models to predict climate change and thus better prepare for shifts in organism's range and distribution
- local geography (soil, terrain, elevation)
- resource availability (nutrients, water)
- land use (rural, city, natural setting)

**Biotic Factors**:
- biotic factors are living organisms or material (for example, organic compounds) that originated from living organisms
- predator and prey species
- disease caused by viruses and microorganisms
- competition for resources (e.g., water and food)
- human influences and interactions

## Population Size and Density

> [!INFO] Define: population size
> number of individual organisms in a population

Population size tells us about the *stability* and *sustainability* of a population.

Larger populations are generally regarded as more stable they have higher genetic diversity compared to a small population. High genetic diversity allows a population as a whole to better adapt to environmental changes

> [!INFO] Define: population density
> number of individual organisms per area or volume in a habitat

Density can determine how easy or difficult it is for populations to acquire resources
- low density populations may have difficulty locating mates
- high density populations will experience an increase in competition for food or water

Generally, organisms with small body size live together in high population density (ex: ants and rabbits)

There are challenges with too low or too high of population density:
- Too Low (below minimum population size)
	- natural social behaviors are deficient
	- unable to find mates
	- normal mating and courtship behaviors do not occur
	- genetic diversity decreases and inbreeding can occur
	- important community connections may be lost that can affect other species
- Too High (above carrying capacity)
	- social behaviors break down
	- increase in disease
	- low food supplies
	- increased chances of conflicts with humans
	- damaged environment from resource overuse

## Researching Populations
The most accurate way to study a population is to count all individuals within the population but this is rarely possible. Instead of counting an entire population, scientists typically study of portion of a population by [[Summary Statistics|sampling]]. 

**Ways of Sampling**:
- Quadrat method = a square area, market with boundaries to study the population size and density of slow moving animals or plants
	- a quadrat is a square that encases an area within a habitat
	- a wooden stake or string is typically used to mark off each quadrat and then a square made from various materials on the ground
- Mark and Recapture = a sampling technique that estimates population size from a number of marked individuals in samples of mobile organisms
	- capture organisms and typically mark them with tags, bands, paint, or some other body marking
	- marked species are released back into the wild and then recaptured and sampled sometime later

## Population Dynamics

> [!INFO] Define: Population Dynamics
> changes over time in population size and composition

Population dynamics tell us how populations interact with other species and with the physical environment. By tracking populations, we can see how they have changed and predict their changes in the future. This influences management decisions and conservation efforts.

Population distribution, size, and density describe a population at a fixed point in time. To study population change over time, scientists use tools of [[Human Populations|demography]], the statistical study of population changes over time. Scientists use statistics like birth rates, death rates, life expectancies, incident of disease, immigration rates and emigration rates.

## Population Growth
Population growth is controlled by **growth factors** (resources like water, space, and food) that individuals need to survive and reproduce so that a population can grow in number. A population that can grow without any environmental limitations, will eventually reach its full **biotic potential**.


> [!INFO] Define: Biotic Potential
> The unrestricted growth of a population as each member of the population survives and produces offspring resulting in maximum growth

### Limiting Factors
> [!INFO] Define: Limiting Factors
> Limiting factors, also called resistance factors, are things that keep a population's biotic potential in check. These are things that directly (predators, disease, fire) or indirectly (competition) reduce a population's size.

**Density-Dependent** limiting factors are *biotic factors* that alters a population's growth and is dependent on the population's density:
- competition for limited resources
- predation
- waste accumulation
- disease
- invasive species

**Intra**specific competition occurs between members of the **same** species.
*Inter*specific competition occurs between members of *different* species.

#### Predation-prey Dynamics
Population sizes of both predators and prey species do not remain constant over time, rather they fluctuate in cycles that reflect their interactions.

More prey -> more predators because more food -> less prey because too many predators -> less predators, no food -> more prey, less predators -> more predators, less prey -> ... and the cycle repeats

---
**Density-Independent** limiting factors alter population independent on the population's density. These factors are not capable of regulating populations at constant levels and often lead to inconsistent, sudden shifts. These factors are most often *abiotic*:
- Natural disasters
- Storms
- Fires
- Floods
- Pollution
- Human activities

In nature, population growth is very complex and density-dependent and density independent factors are quite likely to interact.

Populations that are more dense reacting to environmental density-independent factors will recover differently than a population that is more spread out.

## Population Growth

#### Exponential Growth
Growth rates increase over time as the number of individuals in the population increases. 

This occurs when a population has unlimited resources and little to no environmental limitations and is not sustainable in nature. 

When graphed, this population growth shows a **J-shaped** curve. 

Bacteria growth are the prime example of exponential growth.

#### Logistic Growth
In logistic growth, resources are limited, and this acts to control a population's size because the environment can only support so many individuals.

Individuals must compete for resources and those that are successful will survive, reproduce, and pass on their genetic traits to their offspring, thus producing the most fit individuals (natural selection).

When graphed, logistic population growth displays an **S-shaped** curve.

[[Human Populations|Carrying Capacity]] ($K$) is the maximum population size that a particular environment can support indefinitely. $K$ is observed in logistic growth.

### Population Growth Patterns
Limiting factors interact in complicated ways and produce patterns when it comes to population growth. In nature, populations grow, decline, and fluctuate in different ways.

Populations do NOT permanently remain at carrying capacity. Population ecology is a **dynamic** study in which these factors are constantly changing to influence populations and their growth.

Population density influence how well a population thrives. When a population falls below the minimum viable population or rises above the carrying capacity the species will be challenged.

Some populations experience uneven rise and fall in their numbers; others have more regular cycles of boom (increase) and bust (decrease) referred to as **cyclical oscillations**.

Cyclical oscillations typically occur because of interactions between populations of multiple species or because of density-dependent limiting factors that drive a repeating cycle.

## Life History Strategies

> [!INFO] Define: Life History Strategies
> a species' biological characteristics that influence how quickly its population can potentially increase in number (life span, fecundity (number of organism an organism can produce), or maturity rate)

Life history is shaped by natural selection and produces specific traits for a species such as number of offspring an adult can produce, amount of parental care for offspring, and timing of reproduction.

Life history strategies are different for each species and are dependent on its characteristics, its habitat, the environment and other outside pressures.

An organism's life history strategies and energy budgets will determine the type of reproductive capacity that population will maintain over time.

### Life Tables
Life tables provide data regarding the life history of an organism, divides the population into different age groups, and shows predicted life expectancy.

Life tables typically include:
- mortality rate
- percentage of organisms within specific age intervals
- life expectancies

Life tables can also be plotted as **survivorship curves**. These graphs show the number of individuals surviving at each age interval versus time and can be used to compare the life histories of different populations.

Here are the survivorship curve types and descriptions:
- Type 1:
    - **Description**: High survival rates throughout most of the lifespan, with a steep decline in survival in old age. 
    - This type is typical of species that invest heavily in each offspring, such as humans and large mammals.
- Type 2:
    - **Description**: Constant mortality rate throughout the lifespan. 
    - Individuals have a roughly equal chance of dying at any age. This type is common in birds and some small mammals.
- Type 3:
    - **Description**: High mortality rate in early life, with those surviving early stages living longer. 
    - This type is typical of species that produce many offspring but invest little in each, such as many fish and invertebrates.
## K-Selected vs r-Selected

**K-Selected**:
1. $K$ = carrying capacity
2. mature later and live longer
3. experience a slower growth
4. produce fewer, larger offspring
5. experience a longer gestation period
6. high-level of parental care
7. adapted a stable environment
8. often predators or higher-level consumers
9. niche specialists

Examples: elephants, primates, bears, trees, whales, and humans

**r-Selected**:
1. $r$ = reproductive success
2. mature quickly and have shorter life span, typically small in size
3. experience rapid growth
4. produce many offspreing
5. experience a short gestation period
6. little parental care of offspring
7. adapted to changing environments
8. are often prey species
9. niche generalists

Examples: mice, rabbits, insects, many types of plants

### Boom-and-Bust Cycles
**K-selected** species tend to have stable population size in undisturbed areas. Their numbers increase and decrease in response to the environment. Their population size fluctuates at or near carrying capacity ($K$).

**r-Selected** species tend to have rapid reproductive potential; sudden population growth with high peaks, which may exceed an ecosystem's carrying capacity, followed by a sudden population crash as individuals die or migrate. Some populations may level off at $K$, while others overshoot $K$ and then crash. These cycles in population size are referred to as a **boom-and-bust cycle**.

> [!EXAMPLE] Boom-and-Bust Cycle
> ![[boom_and_bust_cycle.png|300]]


> [!INFO] Define: Top-Down Regulation
> the control a population's size due to pressures from the top tropic level that causes death (ex: predation, natural disasters, and disease)

Top-down models predict changes in population density at one tropic level caused by an inverse change in a higher trophic level.

For example, elk population density declines in Yellowstone due to an increase of wolves in the park.

> [!INFO] Define: Bottom-Up Regulation
> the control of a population's size due to factors at the bottom of a tropic pyramid that control growth and survival (ex: nutrients, water, sunlight, space, and habitat)

This model focuses on how factors at lower trophic levels affect organisms living at higher trophic levels.


## Wildlife Management
**Wildlife Management** works to balance the needs of people with the needs of wildlife (plants and animals). It uses both monitoring programs and research-based programs to maintain healthy populations. Can include reintroduction of native species, hunting, wildlife conservation, and pest control.

Wildlife managers keep wildlife populations healthy, well-maintained, and ensure that humans and wildlife can coexist in nature. Wildlife managers manage population number by:
- monitoring wildlife populations (health, age, sex, birth rate, death rate, migration)
- investing in and conducting research (biology, chemistry, ecology)
- adjusting harvest levels or objectives (catch quota for fish, hunting limits)
- preserving and restoring wildlife habitat (reintroduction of native species)
- providing access and information to the public (park rangers, news, classes)

Wildlife management plans are created by management agencies to protect resources, plants, animals, and to provide long-term strategies for their management.

Plans likely include:
- population management
- habitat management
- costs and expenditures
- outreach and education efforts
- evaluation of different techniques

No two management plans are the same and vary depending on goals, size, available resources, type of habitat, number of different species needing protection, time, viable, schedule, workload, cost, etc.
