**Population and Historical Background**:
- **Population**: As of 2020, there were 61.3 million Hispanics in the U.S., making them the largest minority group at 16% of the population.
- **Historical Silence**: Historically, Hispanics have been less vocal as a unified group compared to African Americans, American Indians, and Asian Americans. Civil rights efforts have been more fragmented, focusing on national origins like Mexico, Cuba, or Puerto Rico rather than a unified Hispanic identity (Johnson, 2005a).

**Legal and Citizenship Issues**:
- **In re Rodriguez (1897)**: The Texas case that addressed Hispanic voting rights and citizenship. Mexican-born Rodriguez was declared white and granted citizenship, thereby protecting Mexican Americans from disenfranchisement (Calavita, 2007).

**Mexican-American War and Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo**:
- **Mexican-American War (1846-1848)**: The war, driven by the annexation of Texas and Manifest Destiny, resulted in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.
- **Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo**: Ended the war and ceded over 525,000 square miles to the U.S. It promised to honor Mexican land grants and protect Mexican citizens in the new territories. Despite these guarantees, many land grants were contested, and Mexican Americans faced discrimination (San Miguel & Valencia, 1998; Gates, 1958).

**Push and Pull Factors**:
- **Labor Migration**: Economic factors and the Mexican Revolution led to significant migration of Mexicans into the U.S. for labor (Romo, 1975).
- **Great Depression and Repatriation**: During the Great Depression, many Mexicans, including U.S. citizens, were repatriated or encouraged to return to Mexico due to unemployment (Balderrama & Rodriguez, 1995).
- **Bracero Program (1942-1964)**: Established to address labor shortages during WWII, it allowed temporary labor from Mexico but also led to illegal immigration due to the program's limitations (Hernandez, 2006).
- **Operation Wetback (1954)**: Aimed to address illegal immigration, resulting in the deportation of about 1 million undocumented workers (Hernandez, 2006).

**Legal Battles and Civil Rights**:
- **Segregation and School Desegregation**: The case of **Mendez et al. v. Westminster School District (1946, 1947)** challenged the de facto segregation of Mexican American students in California, predating the Brown v. Board of Education decision (Johnson, 2005a).
- **Voting Rights**: **White v. Regester (1973)** addressed gerrymandering and the dilution of Hispanic votes in Texas, ensuring that legislative districts reflect population demographics (Johnson, 2005a).
- **Jury Representation**: **Hernandez v. Texas (1954)** recognized Hispanics as a distinct racial/ethnic group under the Fourteenth Amendment, leading to more equitable jury representation (Johnson, 2005a).

**Contemporary Issues**:
- **Sanctuary Cities Debate**:
  - **Yes**: Some argue sanctuary cities should lose federal funding for not enforcing immigration laws, citing concerns about crime and taxpayer costs.
  - **No**: Others argue that sanctuary cities protect undocumented immigrants from harsh federal laws and uphold state rights under the Tenth Amendment, emphasizing humanitarian concerns and the potential benefits of legalizing undocumented immigrants (arguments summarized).

**Civil Rights Movements**:
- **Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan (MEChA)**: A radical group advocating for Chicano rights and the reclamation of lands historically part of Mexico. MEChA's vision includes reclaiming territories acquired by the U.S. in the 19th century (Johnson, 2005a).
