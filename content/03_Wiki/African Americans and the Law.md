## Slavery and the Law
- **Historical Context**: Slavery is an ancient practice and remains in some African Islamic countries today (Murphy, 2014).
- **Indentured Servitude**: In colonial America, indentured servitude allowed people to work off debts or earn passage to the colonies. After a set period (usually 7 years), servants were freed and given land. Most were white, but some Black servants had similar rights.
- **First Enslaved Africans**: The first Africans arrived in Jamestown, Virginia, in 1619. Initially, they were integrated into indentured servitude due to the illegality of slavery under English common law (Wood, 1970).
- **Anthony Johnson Case**: Anthony Johnson, one of the first free African landowners, became involved in a legal case that laid the groundwork for slavery in America. In 1655, Johnson sued to keep John Casor, a Black servant, for life, setting a legal precedent for slavery.
- **Johnson v. Parker (1655)**: Casor, a Black indentured servant, claimed Johnson held him beyond his indenture term. Johnson freed Casor but later sued to retain him for life. The court ruled in Johnson's favor, marking the first legal establishment of lifelong slavery in the colonies.
- **Constitutional References**: The US Constitution does not mention slavery directly but contains provisions supporting it:
  - Article I, Section 9: Allowed importation of enslaved people.
  - Article I, Section 2: Counted enslaved people as three-fifths of a person for representation purposes.
  - Article IV, Section 2: Required return of escaped enslaved people to their owners.
- **Constitutional Debates**: Some argue that the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution contained language that could imply the end of slavery (Wiecek, 2000). The Somerset case (1772) suggested enslaved people should be freed, but this precedent was not followed in the US.
- **Impact**: Constitutional compromises on slavery reflected a balance between northern and southern interests, leading to over 200 years of legal battles for African American rights.

## Key Legal Cases: Amistad and Dred Scott
- **Amistad Case (1839)**:
	- **Background**: Enslaved Africans revolted on the Spanish ship *Amistad* and killed all but two of their captors. They navigated the ship to New York, where they were captured.
	- **Legal Battle**: The captives, led by Sengbe Pieh (Joseph Cinque), were represented by former President John Quincy Adams. Adams argued that the Africans had been kidnapped and should be freed. The Spanish government wanted them tried for murder and piracy, but Adams argued for their freedom based on natural law.
	- **Outcome**: The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Africans, ordering their release and return to Africa. This decision was seen as a moral victory against slavery, despite being based on legal grounds (Howard Jones, 2002).
- **Dred Scott Case (1857)**:
	- **Background**: Dred Scott, born into slavery, petitioned for freedom based on his time in free territories (Illinois and Wisconsin). His case, Scott v. Sandford, was argued before the Supreme Court.
	- **Political Context**: The case occurred during heightened tensions over slavery, with political changes affecting the legal landscape.
	- **Missouri Compromise**: Scott's freedom claim was denied based on the argument that Congress had no power to restrict slavery in the territories and that Scott was considered property under the Fifth Amendment. The ruling also declared the Missouri Compromise unconstitutional.
	- **Supreme Court Decision**: Chief Justice Roger Taney ruled that Black people, even if free, could not be U.S. citizens and thus had no standing to sue in federal court. The decision endorsed slavery and heightened national tensions, contributing to the onset of the Civil War.
	- **Scott’s Outcome**: Scott was eventually granted freedom in 1857 by the purchase from his former owner's sons, but he died shortly thereafter (Wang, 2002).

## Emancipation and Reconstruction Period

- **Civil War Background**:
	- **Initial Goal**: The American Civil War (starting April 12–13, 1861) was initially fought to preserve the Union, not to end slavery. Slavery was a major contributing factor, with the North and South having diverging economies and cultures—North was industrial and opposed slavery due to economic competition, while South’s economy was heavily reliant on slavery.
- **Emancipation Proclamation**:
	- **Purpose**: As the war progressed, the North shifted to include freeing enslaved people as part of its war goals, both to weaken the South and for moral reasons.
	- **Preliminary Proclamation**: Issued in September 1862, it warned that enslaved people in rebellious states would be freed if they did not rejoin the Union by January 1, 1863.
	- **Final Proclamation**: Issued on January 1, 1863, it declared all enslaved people in Confederate states to be free but did not apply to Union-loyal slave states.
- **Thirteenth Amendment**:
	- **Purpose**: To ensure the permanence of emancipation and address potential challenges to the Emancipation Proclamation as a military order, President Lincoln pushed for the Thirteenth Amendment.
	- **Ratification**: Passed by Congress in 1865, it abolished slavery in the United States, ending legal slavery after 200 years.
- **Reconstruction**:
	- **Immediate Post-War**: During Reconstruction, formerly enslaved people gained some rights and protections. The Freedman’s Bureau was established to aid them with food, clothing, education, and land.
	- **Achievements**: African Americans voted in large numbers, held political office, and gained access to public education.
- **Black Codes**:
	- **Repressive Laws**: Despite the progress, Southern states enacted Black Codes to maintain control over African Americans. These laws restricted freedom and imposed harsh penalties for unemployment.
	- **Economic Exploitation**: Unemployed Black individuals could be fined and forced to work to pay off these fines, often leading to exploitation by employers.
- **Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments**:
	- **Fourteenth Amendment (1868)**: Granted citizenship to all persons born or naturalized in the U.S. and provided equal protection under the law.
	- **Fifteenth Amendment (1870)**: Granted voting rights to African American males, prohibiting denial of the vote based on race, color, or previous condition of servitude.

## Emergence of Jim Crow Laws
- **Origins of Jim Crow Laws**:
	- **Definition**: Jim Crow laws enforced racial segregation in the United States.
	- **Term Origin**: The term "Jim Crow" originates from a minstrel show routine from 1832. These laws were rooted in deep-seated racism, which was more entrenched and pervasive than other forms of bigotry like xenophobia or ethnocentrism (Woodward, 1974; Bobo & Kluegel, 1997).
- **Civil Rights Act of 1875**:
	- **Purpose**: Intended to ensure access to public accommodations for all, regardless of race.
	- **Outcome**: The Supreme Court ruled in the Civil Rights Cases (1883) that the Fourteenth Amendment only protected against state discrimination, not private or business discrimination. The Act was deemed unconstitutional for trying to regulate state powers, violating the Tenth Amendment.
- **Rise of Jim Crow Legislation**:
	- **State Actions**: After the Supreme Court's ruling, Southern states enacted laws to enforce racial segregation across all aspects of life. These included poll taxes and literacy tests designed to disenfranchise Black voters.
	- **By 1890s**: Most forms of integration in the South had disappeared (Klarman, 2004).
- **Plessy v. Ferguson (1896)**:
	- **Background**: The case tested the Louisiana law mandating separate but equal accommodations for railroad passengers.
	- **Plaintiff**: Homer Plessy, who was of mixed race and physically indistinguishable from whites, was arrested for sitting in a whites-only car.
	- **Court Ruling**: The Supreme Court upheld the "separate but equal" doctrine, ruling that segregation did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment, as long as facilities were equal (Justice Brown’s opinion) (Klarman, 2004).
- **Williams v. State of Mississippi (1898)**:
	- **Background**: African American Henry Williams challenged the literacy tests and discriminatory practices used to exclude Black individuals from juries and voting.
	- **Court Ruling**: The Supreme Court ruled that literacy tests did not violate the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendments because they were seen as a measure of literacy rather than race. The Court upheld states' rights to set voter eligibility standards (Brinkley et al., 1991).
- **Impact**:
	- **Disenfranchisement**: The decisions in Plessy and Williams allowed Southern states to implement discriminatory practices, effectively disenfranchising Black voters. By the early 20th century, Black political representation in the South had virtually disappeared, and systemic disenfranchisement was widespread (Pinkney, 1969).

## Lynching and Black Protests
- **Divergent Responses to Jim Crowism**:
	- **Booker T. Washington**: Advocated for Black self-help and accommodation to segregation, focusing on vocational training and economic advancement. His approach was seen by some as validating white supremacy but was supported by many whites who favored his conciliatory stance.
	- **W. E. B. Du Bois**: Opposed Washington’s philosophy, arguing for higher education and active political agitation. Du Bois believed that Blacks should demand their full rights and not settle for a subordinate status.
- **Formation of the NAACP**:
	- **Founding**: Du Bois, with the aid of progressive whites, established the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1910.
	- **Focus**: The NAACP targeted the horrific practice of lynching, which was rampant in the early 20th century. From 1892 to 1968, over 70 percent of the 4,743 lynching victims were Black (Constitutional Rights Foundation, 2005).
- **Lynching and Legislative Battles**:
	- **Increased Lynching**: The aftermath of World War I saw a rise in racial violence, including lynching, driven by both returning Black soldiers and racial backlash (Klarman, 2004).
	- **Anti-Lynching Legislation**: Despite the introduction of bills like the Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill (1918) and the Gavagan Bill, Congress failed to pass federal anti-lynching laws due to Southern Democratic filibusters. It wasn’t until the Civil Rights Act of 1968 that federal anti-lynching legislation was enacted (Constitutional Rights Foundation, 2005).
- **Michael Donald Case**:
	- **Incident**: In 1981, Michael Donald was lynched by members of the Ku Klux Klan. This act of racial violence was a response to the Klan’s frustration over a court verdict involving a Black defendant.
	- **Legal Outcome**: The FBI investigated the case, leading to the arrest and conviction of the perpetrators. The civil suit filed by the Southern Poverty Law Center resulted in the Klan being ordered to pay $7 million in punitive damages, forcing the organization to liquidate its assets (Spartacus Educational, 2005).
- **World War II and Postwar Changes**:
	- **Black Migration**: The war effort led to significant migration of Black workers to northern factories, exposing them to less intense racism than in the South and increasing their demands for civil rights.
	- **Executive Actions**: President Franklin Roosevelt’s Fair Employment Practices Committee and President Harry Truman’s integration orders were partly driven by a threatened march on Washington and a desire to address racial inequality in the workforce and military (D’Sousa, 1995; Brinkley et al., 1991).
- **Smith v. Allwright (1944)**:
	- **Issue**: The case challenged all-white primaries, which were justified by some states as private organizational practices.
	- **Outcome**: The Supreme Court ruled that these primaries were subject to state authority and violated the Fifteenth Amendment, marking a significant advance in Black voting rights (Klarman, 2004).
- **Brown v. Board of Education (1954)**:
	- **Decision**: The landmark case declared racial segregation in public schools unconstitutional, overturning the “separate but equal” doctrine established by Plessy v. Ferguson.
	- **Resistance**: The ruling met with intense resistance in the South, with efforts to delay and circumvent desegregation. Despite initial slow progress, the ruling marked the beginning of the end for legalized racial segregation in schools (Rosenberg, 1991).
- **Resistance to Desegregation**:
	- **Social vs. Political Rights**: The resistance to Brown was more pronounced than to Smith because social integration was viewed as a more profound threat than political or civil rights. Social rights involved closer and more personal interactions, which many whites were unwilling to accept (Klarman, 2004).

## Congressional Activity and Civil Rights Legislation

- **Civil Rights Act of 1964**:
	- **Impact**: The Act was a landmark piece of legislation that empowered federal officials to enforce desegregation and withhold federal funds from discriminatory school districts. By 1972–1973, 91.3% of Southern Black schoolchildren were in desegregated schools, a dramatic increase from the limited changes following the Brown decision (Rosenberg, 1991).
	- **Legislative vs. Judicial Impact**: Unlike judicial rulings that could be ignored or misinterpreted, the legislative power of the purse allowed for more immediate and tangible change.

- **Voting Rights Act of 1965**:
	- **Pre-Act Registration**: Prior to the Act, only 5% of Southern Blacks were registered to vote. Post-ruling, this figure rose to 12% in 1947. The Voting Rights Act introduced federal oversight of voter registration and banned literacy tests. By 1970, 66.9% of Southern Black voting-age adults were registered (Rosenberg, 1991).
	- **Supreme Court Endorsements**: The Act's constitutionality was upheld in South Carolina v. Katzenbach (1966), marking a significant legal endorsement of voting rights advancements.

## The Cold War and International Pressure

- **Global Context**:
	- **Cold War Dynamics**: The Cold War, a conflict of ideologies between the democratic United States and the communist Soviet Union, amplified the importance of American racial policies. The U.S. faced international scrutiny and criticism regarding its civil rights record, which affected its global standing.
	- **U.S. Government Responses**: Efforts to improve America’s image led to increased civil rights reforms. For instance, President Truman’s desegregation of the military was partly motivated by concerns about global perceptions (Klarman, 2004). Similarly, President Eisenhower’s administration filed briefs in civil rights cases to counter Communist propaganda against racial discrimination (Dudziak, 2000).

## The Black Lives Matter Movement
- **Founding and Goals**:
	- **Origins**: Established in 2013 by Alicia Garza, Opal Tometi, and Patrice Cullors in response to the acquittal of George Zimmerman, BLM initially aimed to improve police relations with Black communities. The movement has since expanded its goals to include broader demands such as a trillion-dollar job program and the creation of alternative Black institutions (Szetela, 2020).
	- **Growth and Funding**: BLM has grown from a grassroots initiative to a major network with over 30 chapters globally. It has received substantial financial support, including a $100 million grant from the Ford Foundation over six years (Porter & Hanover, 2017).
- **2020 Protests and Public Opinion**:
	- **George Floyd’s Killing**: The killing of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis in 2020 brought BLM to national prominence. The movement's call for police reform resonated widely, though its more radical demand to defund the police was less popular, with limited support across racial and political lines (Edwards-Levy & Robillard, 2020).
	- **Counter Movements**: In response to BLM, the "All Lives Matter" movement emerged, emphasizing a broader inclusivity that also supports law enforcement. This sentiment often overshadows the specific issues BLM addresses, particularly the disproportionate rate of police violence against Black individuals (Washington Post, 2021).
- **Disproportionate Police Violence**:
	- **Statistics**: In 2020, Black Americans were disproportionately affected by police violence. Although Black individuals make up less than 13% of the U.S. population, they were killed by police at more than twice the rate of White Americans, underscoring the specific concerns that BLM seeks to address (Washington Post, 2021).
