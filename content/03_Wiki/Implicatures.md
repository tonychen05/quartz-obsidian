- Drawing conclusions from utterances about the world is crucial for comprehension.
- Different kinds of evidence or reasoning can lead to these conclusions.
- The type of reasoning used depends on the context of the utterance being interpreted.
### Drawing Conclusions:

**Through implication:**
- Speaker 1: I'd really like a cup of coffee.
- Speaker 2: There's a place around the corner called Joe's
Speaker 2 implies to Speaker 1 to get a cup of coffee at Joe's

The utterance contains an **implicature**.

> [!NOTE] Inference
> **Inference** is the conclusion interactants are reasonably entitled to draw based on the circumstances.

## Scalar Implicatures

> [!NOTE] Scalar Implicatures
> "In general, the utterance of a given value on a scale will implicate that, as far as the speaker knows, no higher value applies."

- All of the cookies were eaten.
- Most of the cookies were eaten.
- Some of the cookies were eaten.
