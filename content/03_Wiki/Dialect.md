any variety of a language that is characterized by systematic differences from other varieties of the same language

Difference in structural and lexical features
Phonological variation = *accent*

**Standard dialect**: often the variety that is used by political leaders, the media, and higher socioeconomic classes 
- All other dialects: **nonstandard dialects**
- Standard dialects "don't have an accent"

**Prestige**: having high standing
- A dialect of prestige is the one in power, **nothing to do with linguistic features** (social construct)
- **Overt prestige**: prestige associated with the standard dialect
- **Covert prestige**: prestige associated with the nonstandard dialect

Another complication for the criterion of mutual intelligibility is found in a phenom-enon known as a dialect continuum. This is a situation where, in a large number of geo-graphically contiguous dialects, each dialect is closely related to the next, but the dialects at either end of the continuum (scale) are mutually unintelligible. Thus, dialect A is intel-ligible to dialect B, which is intelligible to dialect C, which is intelligible to dialect D; but D and A are not mutually intelligible
