- Most studied and probably the most important type of change
- Difficult to see how other parts change without studying sound change
- The basis of language relationships and reconstructions of proto-languages

Not every introduction of a phonological process is considered a sound change
- The basic form must be permanently altered in all contexts

# Phonetic vs. Phonological
**Phonetic change**: a change in pronunciation of an allophone (no effect on phonemes)
**Phonological change:** a change to the phonological system in some way
- changing the distribution, adding or deleting phonemes
- aspirated stops in English

**Unconditioned Sound Change**: a sound change that occurs, no matter where it occurs or what it occurs next to

**Conditioned Sound Change:** when sounds are influenced by neighboring sounds

	- occurs when a sound is no longer pronounced
- **Insertion**
	- occurs when a sound is added to the pronunciation of a word
- **Metathesis**
	- a change in order of sounds
