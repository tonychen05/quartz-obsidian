## Natural and Synthetic Pollutants

> [!INFO] Define: Pollutant
> a natural or synthetic substance that adversely affects or causes damage to air, water, soil, and/or organisms

> [!INFO] Define: Toxin
> poisonous substance produced by an organism (e.g., bacteria, plant, fungi, or animal)
> Ex: snake venom, bee sting, poison ivy, poisonous mushrooms

Natural toxin are poisonous substance produced by a living organism, it often is not persistent (e.g.,, scorpion venom).
- synthesized by living organisms
- while not harmful to the organism itself, it is harmful or even deadly to other organisms

Synthetic toxin are poisonous substances made by humans, often persists in environment and does not degrade over time (e.g., dioxin, PCB, DDT)
- created by humans in a lab
- may or may not be found in nature
- created for a particular purpose (e.g. mosquitos) but have unintended consequences to other organisms (kill fish, birds, humans)
- Examples:
	- DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane)
		- first synthesized in a lab in 1874
		- could be used to kill insects
		- used extensively during WWII to fight malaria
		- carcinogen, developmental toxicity, and reproductive toxicity
		- many targeted pest species developed a resistance to DDT
		- banned in United States in 1972
			- Rachel Carson was a marine biologist an enviornmentalist who pulished *Silent Spring* in 1962. Highlighted the significant die-off of wildlife species following only two decades of extensive DDT and other herbicides and pesticides. *Silent Spring* shared the concerns surrounding synthetic pesticides and inspired national change in policy that eventually banned DDT.
	- BPA (bisphenol A)
		- first synthesized in a lab in 1891
		- widely used in the 1940s and 1950s to coat the inside of metal food cans and in production of plastic containers, including baby bottles, water bottles, toys, car parts, hospital equipment
		- studies in 1990s began to show association between BPA and serious medical conditions, countries began to ban the chemical in 2000s, large retailers discontinued use of BPA products
		- plastic industry challenged the science and claimed BPA was safe
		- According to the EPA, releases of BPA into the environment exceed 1-million pounds per year
		- Fish and aquatic species has been shown to be especially sensitive
		- acts as an endocrine disruptor and can negatively impact growth, reproduction and development (decreased fertility, developmental malformations, altered nervous system and immune system  function, certain cancers)
		- interferes with the production, processing, and transmission of hormones in humans, frogs, fish, and other wildlife
	- PCB (polychlorinated biphenyl)
		- first synthesized in a lab in 1881
		- used by electrical industry, airline industry as coolant and hydraulic fluid, electrical industry, plastics industry, flame retardant
		- used widely in the 1930s-1970s with the manufacturing peaking in the 1960s
		- many of PCBs were manufactured by Boeing and General Electric (GE)
		- banned in USA in 1979
		- still being released into the environment from hazardous waste sites and the improper disposal of wastes
		- PCBs do not readily break down, they can remain in Earth's atmosphere, water, and soil for decades
	- Dioxin

**Per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances** (PFAS) are known by scientists as "forever chemicals" because their chemical structure is very stable, which prevents them from breaking down in the environment. PFAs is a class of thousands of chemicals that are found in many everyday products (e.g., stain resistant carpet, nonstick pans, firefighting foam). PFAS has shown up in drinking water in the United States and has been linked to diseases like cancer, liver damage, decreased fertility, asthma, and thyroid disease.

## Toxicity
> [!INFO] Define: Toxicity
> degree to which a substance can cause harmful effects

There are many factors that can determine the toxicity of a chemical substance. A toxin may cause visible damage (e.g., paralysis, tissue damage), or a test may be used by a scientist to measure the toxin's effect.

Acute toxicity is obvious and immediate as it causes immediate harm to an organism through a single or short-term exposure. For example, breathing in smog which results in an asthma attack.

Chronic toxicity occurs over an extended period of time, usually upon repeated or continuous exposure, sometimes lasting for the entire life of an organism. For example, cancer caused by chronic 20-year exposure to PCB at work.


> [!INFO] Define: Persistance
> length of time a pollutant remains in the environment

Low persistence = pollutant breaks down quickly in the environment, for example due to exposure to sunlight or because it is metabolized and degraded by a plan or microorganism

High persistence - pollutant is stable and takes  along time to break down, pollutant has potential to negatively impact organisms long after initial release

Many synthetic compounds cannot be broken down because they are new compounds and naturally occurring environmental microorganisms (or plants) have not has enough time to evolve mechanisms to degrade the compounds.


> [!INFO] Define: Solubility
> ability of a chemical substance to dissolve in water

**Water soluble substance**:
- readily dissolve in water
- can be safer for humans because filtered and passed in urine
- animals can excrete in urine
- still potential toxic at high does or continual low dose
- high impact on aquatic organisms
- easy uptake in animals and excreted in sewer

**Fat soluble substance**:
- does not dissolve in water
- dissolves in lipids and fats
- can cross cell membrane and cause disease from inside the cell
- very hard to eliminate from organism's body
- some break down in liver
- stored and accumulates in fatty tissue of animals

> [!INFO] Define: Endocrine Disruptors
> chemicals that mimic a hormone or prevent a hormone from having an effect (e.g., BPA, PCB, PFAS)

Exposure to chemicals that interfere with the endocrine system can lead to: developmental malformations, interference with reproduction, increased cancer risk, and disturbances in the immune and nervous system function.

Endocrine disruptors (hormone mimics) have been shown to impact ecosystems and the wildlife within them. Scientists are researching the abnormalities and reproductive diseases that these chemicals can cause in some species including fish, amphibians, and humans.

Most common exposure pathways are **inhalation**, **ingestion**, and **skin absorption**. The exposure pathway can determine the toxin's effect and extent of harm.

The **frequency** of exposure and length of **time** exposure also control toxicity. Acute exposure may cause little harm whereas chronic exposure may cause significant harm.

Toxicity is also controlled by a person's individual variables such as genetics, age, and general health status. Toxins are often more harmful to very young or very old. Genetic factors can play a role in a person's vulnerability.


> [!INFO] Define: Chemical Risk Assessment
> the process of weighing costs versus benefits associated with any chemical

It is impossible to fully understand and assess all potential interactions among the many chemicals we are exposed to daily. Reality includes practicality, economic forces, and the basic need for the chemical.

**Toxicologists** are scientists who use biology and chemistry to determine if a substance is harmful to humans, wildlife, or the environment; they also determine at which dose at which a substance becomes harmful.

The U.S. **Environmental Protection Agency** (EPA) "regulates the production and distribution of commercial and industrial chemicals, in order to ensure that chemicals for sale and use in the U.S. do not harm human health or the environment." New chemicals must go through a review process before they are approved for use.

The 1976 **Toxic Substances Control Act** (TSCA) helps the EPA to regulate the production, use, and disposal of chemicals in the United States.

The U.S. **Food and Drug Administrations** (FDA) is "responsible for protecting the public health by ensuring the safety, efficacy, and security of human and veterinary drugs, biological products, and medical devices; and by ensuring the safety of our nation's food supply, cosmetics, and products that emit radiation."

## The Fate of Pollutants

> [!INFO] Define: Bioaccumulation
> accumulation of substance in an organism over time

This occurs when an organism absorbs and stores more of a substance than it can eliminate.

Hydrophobic pollutants like DDT and PCB are fat soluble and therefore bioaccumulate in fatty tissue. They are difficult to get rid of, they build up over time, and can eventually cause disease.

BPA is fat soluble, but the liver can convert it to a water-soluble form, which is excreted in urine.

> [!INFO] Define: Biomagnification
> the process by which chemical substances found in the environment move up the food web at increasing concentrations in organisms

Substance accumulates in the bottom of the food chain and increases progressively as it moves up a food chain. Organisms at higher trophic levels are especially vulnerable because toxins have increased in concentration potentially reaching toxic levels.

Pollutants travel by air, water, gravity, living organisms, soil. They are almost always constantly moving. Pollutants touch every part of the planet.

Hazardous waste is waste "with a chemical composition or other property that makes it capable of causing illness, death, or some other harm to humans, plants, animals, and ecosystems when mismanaged or released into the environment."


> [!INFO] Define: Superfund Site
> a location in the United States that is severely contaminated with hazardous waste and requires extensive and long-term clean up

These sites require remediation of contaminated soils, surface water, and groundwater.

An estimated 1.3-million pounds of PCBs flowed into upper Hudson River from two GE factories for 30 years before PCBs were banned in 1977. Between 2009-2015, over 5-million cubic yards of PCB-contaminated sediment was removed from the Hudson Riverbed. The PCB waste was loaded onto barges and shipped by train 2,000 miles away to hazardous waste sites in Andrews, Texas. Cleanup of this Superfund site will cost billions of dollars and take decades to complete. 

## Studying Pollutants
**Epidemiologists** are scientists who determine incidence, distribution, and cause of toxins or pathogens to prevent spread and better control them.

**Toxicologists** are scientists who detects, measures, and analyzes properties of toxins or pathogens and how they affect cells, tissue, and organisms.

The **Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)** detects and responds to new and emerging health threats and tackle the biggest health problems causing death and disability for Americans. The CDC also does the following tasks:
- Putting science and advanced technology into action to prevent disease 
- Promoting healthy and safe behaviors, communities, and environment
- Developing leaders and training public health workforce, including disease detectives
- Taking the health pulse of the nation

Toxicologists study toxins using two types of experiments:
- In vitro ("in glass"): experiment in Petri dish or test tube
- In vivo ("in the body"): experiment within lab animals

> [!INFO] Define: Dose-response relationship
> The response of an organism (or protein, cell, tissue) related to exposure to an agonist (chemical, stimulant, or toxin) can be described by a **dose response curve**.


> [!INFO] Define: Half Life ($t_{1/2}$)
> Time required for a substance's quantity to reduce by half its value

Rule-of-thumb for radioactive material: a material that has decayed by 10 half-lives has decayed sufficiently and no longer is a risk.

Example: Plutonium-239 has a half-life of 24,000 years. Therefore we must store this material for 240,000 years before it no longer poses a threat to humans or other forms of life.

Pollutants in the environment take different amounts of time to break down, which we measure as the pollutant's half-life $(t_{1/2})$.

A substance with a long half-time (like $t_{1/2}=2000$ years) will take hundreds to millions of years to break down. They are persistent pollutants because they are stable and thus pose a long-term problem.

A substance with a short half-time (like $t_{1/2}=14$ days) will break down in days to months.


> [!INFO] Define: LD50
> amount of substance that when given to test animals result in $50\%$ of the animals dying

LD refers to "lethal dose" and is usually tested on small mammals because they have similar physiology to humans. Toxicologists use LD50 to determine acute toxicity. LD50 typically given in milligrams of substance per kilogram of bodyweight $(\frac{mg}{kg})$.

A substance's "safe dose" or **threshold dose** is the minimum dose (or concentration) of a substance (typically a drug) that triggers a detectable biological response.

Because there is uncertainty in determination of safe dose (e.g., differences in mice and human), regulatory agencies typically add a factor of $100$ or $1000$ to be on the safe side.

For example, if evidence suggests a substance is safe at $100$ parts per million (ppm) then scientists may set the environmental standard at 1 ppm for adults and 0.1 ppm for children.
