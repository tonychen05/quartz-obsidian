Shamanism shares many features with animism and in some cases, it would be difficult to attempt to clearly distinguish between the two. The word “*shaman*” is derived from the Manchu (_Manju_) language of northeast China. The term literally means “one who knows” and refers to a shaman’s knowledge of the unseen supernatural world.

The basic function of shamans is to directly communicate between the present world of humans and the unseen world of the spirits.
