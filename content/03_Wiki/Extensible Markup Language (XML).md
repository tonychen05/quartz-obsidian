**XML** is a textual document format used all over the web.

Used to represent *hierarchically organized* data for "ease of use" by humans and computers


> [!NOTE] XML Declaration
> An **XML Declaration** is the first line of well-formed XML file
> - `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>`

An XML document (excluding the declaration line) is made up of:
- A *top-level element*
- A string of zero or more *child elements* of the top-level element, each of which is exactly like the top-level element of an XML document

It is very similar to a [[Tree]]: the structure of an XML document is also *[[Recursion|recursive]]*
