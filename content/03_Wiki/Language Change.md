All languages change (at least the living ones)

Two types of change/analysis:
- **Synchronic**: looking at a language at a single point in time
- **Diachronic**: studying language development through time

# Morphological Change
### Analogy
the influence of one form or set of forms over another (analogical change)
	A:B::C:X

rhyme : rhymed :: climb : climbed

Analogy affects **paradigms** (a set of inflectionally related forms)

### Back formation
the creation of a new stem form via reanalysis and analogy

worker : work :: burglar : burgle
operation : operate :: orientation : orientate

### Folk Etymology
reanalysis of obscure morphemes in terms of more familiar morphemes

Alzheimer's Disease > old-timer's disease
nepotism > nephew-tism

### Acronyms
a word formed from the initial sounds or letters of a phrase

**L**ight **A**mplification through **S**imulation **E**mission of **R**adiation > laser
**P**ersonal **I**dentification **N**umber > PIN

### Blends
combinations of the parts of two words

**br**eakfast + l**unch** = brunch
**smo**ke + f**og** = smog

### Clipping
shortening words

examination > exam
mathematics > math

### Coinages
words created "out of thin air"

kodak

### Conversion
words created by shifting the part of speech without changing the form of the word (no [[derivation]])

hammer (noun) > hammer (verb)

### Eponyms
named for persons somehow connected with them

Julius Caesar > kaiser/tsar
James Watt > watt
